The 'Tropfbruch' quarry is probably the best outcrop for interpreting the distributional patterns of biotic successions and communities of a late Triassic patch reef. Our study is based on the interpretation of a) outcrop photographs, b) reef maps resulting from quadrat transects, and c) the analysis of quantitative data describing the distribution and frequency of reef organisms and sediment. A new methodological approach (combination of reef mapping and photo-transects) is used to obtain quantitative field data which can be compared in greater detail with data from modern coral reefs investigated by corresponding quantitative surveys.  Three unconformities and three well-defined 'reef growth stages' reflecting the vertical and lateral development of the reef structure were differentiated using transects:  Stage 1, representing the reef growth optimum, is characterized by laterally differentiated coral reef knobs with corals in growth position. Criteria supporting this interpretation are the extraordinary size of the corals, their preservation in situ and the great thickness of this interval. The massive coral Pamiroseris grew under higher energy conditions at the rim of the reef knob, whereas branching Retiophyllia colonies preferred less agitated water in the center. Vertical changes are reflected by an increase in frequency of the dasycladacean alga Diplopora adnetensis and by the decreasing size of Retiophyllia. These sedimentological and biological criteria together with the unconformity above indicate a fall in the sea level as a major control mechanism.  Stage 2, separated from stage 3 by an unconformity caused by partial subaerial exposure and karstification, is characterized by vertically stacked coral successions with diverse reef debris. Facies heterogeneity is reflected by differences in the diversity, taphonomy and packing density of reef-building organisms as well as by differences in sediment input from the platform. Water depths and accommodation space were lower, therefore minor sea level fluctuations had a stronger effect on the biotic composition. The high percentage of coral debris and corals reworked by storms and the increase in the input of platform sediment led to a reduction of reef growth.  Stage 3, again separated at the base by an unconformity associated with karstification, is characterized by bioclastic sediments with isolated reefbuilders forming a level-bottom community. The distribution of different coral morphotypes suggests that sea level fluctuations were not the only controlling factor. Variations in the substrate were caused by differences in the input of platform sediment.  The vertical changes in reef community structures correspond to a sequence of 'allogenic replacements', because the change from one community to another is the result of extrinsic environmental factors (short-term subaerial exposure of parts of the reef structure and renewed flooding). Our new data provide no support for the model of ecological reef successions to the Adnet reef. The three-step development seen in Adnet documents the response of low-diverse coral associations to variations caused by small-scale sea level changes, storm activity and sedimentation.  The distribution of communities as well as the vertical development of the Adnet reef structure offer no general model of Alpine Upper Rhaetian reefs, because of the particular setting of the patch reef (platform reef surrounded by calcareous sands). Only the 'capping beds' of the Upper Rhaetian Reef Limestone of the Steinplatte exhibit criteria similar to Adnet (high coverage of spatially separated Retiophyllia A and Retiophyllia B communities, strong inpact of freshwater dissolution pointing to subaerial exposure and small-scale karstification).  Potential modern analogues of features seen in the coral communities of Adnet are the internal structure of the Retiophyllia thickets, the key role of branching corals within the communities, the scattered distribution and low and even diversity of corals subsequent to breaks in settlement, segration patterns of corals indicating 'contact avoidance', toppling of large coral colonies by intensive boring, and decreasing coral coverage from deeper and sheltered settings to more shallower water depths.","Austria","47.7","13.1667","22963","29.8636407331","24.0155922233","32.6069","16.4294"

Part of abstract from 1306.
The Nimaloksa Fm. documents progradation of a carbonate ramp in the latest Camian (Lower Member), followed in the Early Norian by subtidal mixed carbonate/terrigenous sedimentation (Middle Member) and by platform carbonate deposits (Upper Member). Next, the major disconformity at the base of  the Alaror Group testifies to an extensional tectonic event, followed by rapid increase in quartzo-feldspathic detritus in the late Early Norian. Siliciclastic supply is reduced only during flooding stages, marked by oolitic ironstone or phosphatic condensed horizons ('Juvavites beds', 'Monotis shale'). Cleaner waters foster local development of knoll reefs around the Early/Middle Norian boundary ('Coral limestone'). Accumulation rates gradually begin to decrease before the close of the Triassic, when the 'Quartzite series' records a sharp regressive event, followed by renewed transgression at the base of the Kioto Group.","India","32.1","78.1667","36386","-34.6115267375","51.4577932841","-24.8587","48.0545"

Ref. 1339:
After initial opening of Neotethys in the Permian, thermal subsidence and deepening continued in the Triassic. In the Scythian, three pelagic nodular carbonate intervals of Early Griesbachian to Early Dienerian, Early to mid-Smithian and latest Smithian to earliest Aegean age are interbedded with shelfal shales (Tamba Kurkur Formation). Ammonoid- and conodont-rich condensed carbonates were deposited on the outer shelf, with maximum depths around 150 div 200 m reached during transgressive stages. The Anisian to lowermost Norian shelfal succession mostly consists of marly limestones and marls (Mukut Formation). Thick calcareous siltstones rapidly accumulated in the Carnian, testifying to a new stage of tectonic extension affecting the Tethys Himalayan passive margin. The thick Tarap Formation of largely mid-Norian age points to strong continuing subsidence. Interbedded siltstones and subarkosic sandstones ('lower member') are locally overlain by coral-bearing patch reefs ('middle member'). Chamosite-bearing hybrid arenites deposited at transgressive stages characterize the 'upper member'. The Triassic succession is capped by subarkoses and quartzarenites, interbedded with dolomitic to bioclastic hybrid sandstones and silty limestones ('Quartzite Series') , in turn overlain by the Kioto Lime stone.","Nepal","28.7","83.9667","67621","-40.6508969777","51.8400260353","-30.8982","48.3935"

Abstract of ref. 1461:
Some small-scaled Norian-Rhaetian reefs and reef mounds are imbedded within the shales, siltstones and siliciclastic-carbonate deposits of the Nayband Formation in central Iran. These deposits belong to the central Iranian plate as part of the Cimmerian Continent. Most of the biogenic rocks have a biostromal geometry, biohermal
constructions are rare. Inozoid, sphinctozoid, and chaetetid sponges are, beside of corals and other reef builders, the most important reef organisms within these bioconstructions. In some reefs a variety of hexactinellid sponges also occur. The following inozoid sponges are described in this paper: Radiofibra norica n. sp., Permocorynella maxima n. sp., ? Sestrostomella robusta, Marawandia iranica, n. gen., n. sp. and Enaulofungia? triassica n. sp. The first four taxa are among the most abundant sponges within the Nayband Formation where it is exposed in several localities in central Iran. Enaulofungit? triassica, however, is not an abundant sponge there. These inozoid sponges have never been
reported from the Triassic deposits of this region. Radiofibra, until now known only from the Upper Perrnian of Djebel Tebaga (Tunisia), is reported here for the first time from Triassic rocks. The stratigraphic as well as the
paleogeographic distribution of all the genera are discussed.","Iran","33.5667","51.4833","37960","24.6026984295","64.025003497","33.1704","41.0511"

Abstract ref. 1368:
The Permian Capitan reef was a predominantly heterotrophic ecosystem strongly differentiated into open surface and cryptic communities. Unlike modern phototrophic coralgal reefs, most of the preservable epibenthos was housed within the cryptos and zonation developed only in the shallow parts of the reef. Contrary to established opinion, most sphinctozoan sponges did not grow upright to form a baffling framework but rather were pendent cryptobionts, as were nodular bryozoans and rare solitary rugose corals and crinoids. Indeed, many members of the cryptos were obligate    cryptobionts. Much of the Middle Capitan reef framework was constructed by a scaffolding of large frondose    bryozoans, with the subsidiary platy sphinctozoan Guadalupia zitteliana. Bathymetrically shallow areas of both the Middle and Upper Capitan reef, however, were characterized by platy sponges. In parts of the Upper Capitan, some platy sponges (Gigantospongia discoforma) reached up to 2 m in diameter and formed the ceilings of huge cavities which supported an extensive cryptos. In the absence of destructive forces (both biotic and physical) prevalent on modern reefs, the relatively fragile Capitan reef remained intact after the death of the constructing organisms. Rigidity was imparted to this community by a postmortem encrustation of Tubiphytes and Archaeolithoporella, together with
microbial micrite. The resultant cavernous framework was partially infilled with sediment and preserved by
synsedimentary intergrowth of aragonitic botryoids and Archaeolithoporella. Extensive cement precipitation was
favoured by a number of factors including deep anoxia, which generated upwelling waters with elevated alkalinity.
Although the accumulation rate of the Capitan may have been comparable to that of modern coralgal reefs, both the trophic structure and relative contributions of inorganic and organic carbonate were profoundly different.","United States","31.8728","-104.8583","24203","5.35392397197","-37.2500799735","4.06877","-33.4747"

Abstract ref. 426:
An Early Jurassic (Sinemurian) reef in Telkwa Range, British Columbia, Canada, yields coral species previously known from Morocco, Great Britain, Italy, Peru, and Chile. The principal constructional coral, Phacelostylophyllum rugosum (Laube), known from the Upper Triassic Dolomite Alps in northern Italy, is a holdover species. This coral survived the mass extinctions of the end-Triassic without leaving any other Jurassic records outside Canada. Other corals from the Telkwa reef include Stylophyllopsis victoriae (Duncan) and Actinastraea minima Beauvais known from Jurassic rocks of the Tethys. Closely related corals, Phacelostylophyllum chocolatensis (Wells) and Actinastraea plana (Duncan), are from southern Peru. The paleogeographic occurrence of the Canadian reef in the volcanic terrane of Stikinia supports the contention that volcanic islands in distant outposts of the ancient Pacific served as refugia. In the aftermath of the end-Triassic reef decimation affecting the Tethys, corals and reef-building activities continued on ancient islands of the ancestral Pacific. The Hispanic Corridor, connecting the western Tethys with the western Pacific, may have played an important role during Sinemurian time.","United States","54.3833","-127.1333","21251","51.068062605","-50.2912534689","26.7477","-69.4371"

Abstract of ref. 1252:
The epifaunal, rudist-like bivalve Lithiotis formed extensive bioherms during the Pliensbachian and Toarcian ages of the Early Jurassic. The best developed bioherms in North America occur in the Pliensbachian Robertson Formation of east-central Oregon, a unit deposited in a shallow sea transgressing across the Suplee shelf. A typical bioherm consists of three biofacies that coexisted laterally and replaced each other vertically. The reef flank assemblage is the most diverse consisting of Nerinea gastropods, terebratulid brachiopods and Lithiotis debris in a calcarenite or calcilutite matrix. The death assemblage consists of tightly packed, current-aligned Lithiotis valves with gastropods and brachiopods much reduced in numbers. The core of the reef is built almost exclusively of in situ Lithiotis forming a bafflestone with a calcilutite matrix. Lithiotis inhabited a stressful environment inimical to most invertebrates since diversity is very low and there is no evidence of bioerosion. During the Pliensbachian, Lithiotis formed an endemic centre encompassing western North America and the Tethyan Ocean, linked through central America and the central Atlantic by the Hispanic Corridor. By the close of the Pliensbachian it had disappeared from North America but in the Toarcian made its first appearance in South America. By the end of the Toarcian, Lithiotis was extinct.","United States","44.05","-119.6833","21259","41.689893506","-50.3791546595","29.3093","-56.0165"

Buildups in the Lodgepole Formation were deposited throughout the Kinderhookian to Osagean Williston Basin. The Williston Basin was tectonically active at this
time as the depositional axis of the basin was shifting from a northerly connection to the ocean through the Elk Point Basin in Alberta to a westerly connection through
the Central Montana Trough. This structural setting provided a range of depositional sites for buildups to develop on shelves, ramps, intrabasinal blocks and around
intrashelf basins. 
     A textural, compositional and geometric range of buildups record a spectrum of depositional processes from hydrodynamically deposited grainstone shoals to
organically mediated reefs and mud-dominated mounds. Geometries range from lens-shaped shoals and banks to mounds. Lensoidal buildups are associated with
coarser grainstone and packstone textures as well as other shallow water indicators such as ooids and, or, photoautotrophic corals. Mound-shaped geometries
generally are dominated by muddier textures and are associated with deeper-water indicators such as filter feeding organisms with delicate skeletons. 
     A textural spectrum of buildups ranges from mud-dominated with few bryozoans and crinoids, to crinoid, bryozoan grainstones with, and without, coral
framestones or ooids. Mud dominated buildups are best exemplified by mud mound outcrops in two locations in the Bridger Range in Montana. The coarsest
buildups are exemplified by coral, crinoid, bryozoan reefs at two outcrops in the Little Belt Mountains in Montana, and by crinoid, ooid grainstones in the subsurface
of  Manitoba (Canada), and along the Cedar Creek Anticline in North Dakota and Montana. Mound complexes comprised of a broad mixture of textures from
grainstones and organically mediated wackestones and mudstones are known from three outcrops in the Big Snowy Mountains in Montana, and drill cores from
Saskatchewan (Canada), and Montana and North Dakota. 
     Buildup textures, compositions and depositional styles vary according to paleodepositional location in the Lodgepole sea as a response to hydrodynamic
variations, trophic requirements and water qualities. The occurrence of organically mediated buildups is widely distributed: 1) on, or around, intrabasinal blocks and
basins, 2) on the basin floor, 3) at the base of, or across the slope/ramp, or 4) near the top of the slope/ramp. Grainstone shoals and sheet sands were deposited on
the Lodgepole shelf near the break in shelf slope or high on the ramp. The spectrum of buildups reflects the wide range in environmental variables and the diversity of
settings for buildups to develop in the Lodgepole sea.","United States","46.2","-104.3667","","1.62531046362","-97.1524242219","-10.0975","-41.1996"

Abstract of ref. 1057:
An Upper Triassic (Upper Norian-Rhaetian) carbonate complex, composed of open marine to reefal deposits, has been investigated for the first time in Eastern Sulawesi. The age is based on the occurrence of benthic foraminifera, and also of the Upper Sevatian to Rhaetian conodont Misikella posthernsteini Kozur and Mock. Palynological assemblages contain Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic palynomorphs. The scleractinian coral Retiophyllia seranica and the chaetetid sponge Blastochaetetes intabulata, together with Solenoporacean algae, are the main framebuilders of the reefal facies. The entire carbonate series, composed of conodont bearing limestones, reefal deposits, and intertidal/supratidal cryptalgal laminites, shows a general regressive trend from a marginal to an inner platform environment. The relationship between microfaunal distribution and sequence analysis is discussed. The Upper Triassic foraminifers and palynomorphs of Eastern Sulawesi show affinities to microfaunas of the Australian-Indonesian southern Tethyan domain, and the general organisation of the platform should be investigated through further studies from Banda Sea dredgings.","Indonesia","-1.9833","121.3333","67677","-37.0610137716","104.839100819","21.4298","125.493"

Abstract of ref. 1814:
Early Triassic framestones were discovered in the interior of an isolated, marine carbonate platform in the Nanpanjiang basin. The framestones occur in two horizons: (1) the lowermost Triassic (Griesbachian), as biostromes as much as 15 m thick, and (2) the upper part of the Lower Triassic (Smithian or Spathian) as isolated domal or inverted conical mounds as much as 1.5 m thick. The mounds and biostromes consist of a rigid calcimicrobial framework enclosing a network of internal cavities, 1 to 3 cm across, filled with peloidal-skeletal sediment. The framework is made of irregular-to-tufted masses of chambered-to-clotted micrite structures referable to Renalcis, a calcified coccoid cyanobacteria. The framework is reinforced by microbial induced micritic crusts as well as marine cement. Metazoan fossils within the framework include gastropods, bivalves, ostracodes, spirorbids, and brachiopods. The Early Triassic is widely considered to have been a global gap in reef and reef mound development. The global reef gap concept has formed the foundation of models of reef evolution and of the reorganization of reef ecosystems after the end-Permian extinction. These models should be revised to account for the existence of Early Triassic calcimicrobial mounds and biostromes discussed herein.","China","25.55","106.8667","85070","8.79804365354","122.844153389","5.80665","98.3741"

Abstract of ref. 2173:
Microbial-serpulid communities are the main reef-builders of most Norian-Rhaetian carbonate platforms of Italy. They represent minor, yet significant communities in the shallow western Tethys, in contrast with the highly diversified sponge- and coral-dominated Dachstein reefs widespread from Eastern Alps to Australia. The microbial-serpulid build-ups are systematically associated with narrow intraplatform troughs and developed on the outer margin-upper slope area under marine conditions unsuitable for the development of coralgal reefs. The development of these settings can be related to transtensional tectonics affecting an elongate belt which was roughly parallel to the Piedmont-Ligurian Ocean spreading axis during the Jurassic. Dysoxic and mesosaline waters are the main cause of the success of the Norian microbial-serpulid build-ups. Whereas, from the late Norian to the Rhaetian, eutrophication and climate change control their distribution. These environments acted during Norian-Rhaetian times as refuges, where opportunitistic organisms could survive and build frameworks during a period otherwise dominated by coralgal reefs.","Italy","39.9167","15.8667","38046","12.2030780063","20.4606148257","18.245","14.0673"

Many patch reefs. Total thickness of reefal facies exceeds 100 m.
Toomey (1991) suggested outer shelf deposition:
The only outcrops of marine Upper Permian strata in North Africa form an inlier in the Djebel Tebaga area of southern Tunisia. Those outcrops occupy 18km2 (6.9 M2), and comprise the western tip of the Late Permian tethyan seaway. Late Permian marine sediments exposed in southern Tunisia are up to 850m (2789 ft) thick, and grade upward into nonmarine red beds of Permo-Triassic age. Those are unconformably overlapped by flat-lying Jurassic and Cretaceous sediments. Paleogeographically, the Tunisian Permian outcrops represent a biohermal complex situated between a subsurface shale basin to the north, and to the south varied shelf sediments on the margin of the Sahara Shield. Comparison of the Tunisian bioherms to the Permian reef complex of the southwestern United States indicates similarities in biotic composition. Cement fabrics are of major significance at both locations, and are very similar. Both biohermal/reef sequences appear to have been deposited in a shelf-margin paleoenvironment, although the sediments in Tunisia are thin-bedded cyclical or repetitive lithologies associated with overall upward shoaling sequences.","Tunisia","33.4333","10.3","41658","-3.925181548","13.1829468564","-7.00595","18.5345"

Abstract ref. 323:
Carbonate rocks in the Phatthalung area and others in Peninsular Thailand have been known as the Permian Rat Buri Limestone. The study area is characterized by several isolated limestone mountains and is located in Phatthalung province. Micropaleontological study of these carbonate rocks indicates that they should be assigned a late Early to Late Triassic age. The Chaiburi Formation is newly proposed and divided into three members: The Phukhaothong Dolomite, Chiak Limestone and Phanomwang Limestone in ascending order. The Phukhaothong Dolomite consists of thickly bedded to massive dolomite and yields Neospathodus kummeli Sweet, N. waageni Sweet, N. cfr. waageni Sweet and other conodonts that indicate Dienerian to Smithian (Early Triassic). The Chiak Limestone Member consists of bedded and laminated limestone with intercalated thin chert layers and nodules. This limestone commonly yields Early Triassic to Middle Triassic conodonts such as Neospathodus timorensis (Nogami) and Neospathodus kockeli (Tatge), both reliable indicators of latest Spathian to early Anisian, and rare occurrences of Neogondolella bulgarica (Budurov and Stefanov), an indicator of the middle Anisian. The Phanomwang Limestone Member is mostly massive limestone with intercalated reef limestone (coral buildups) and yields abundant fossils that indicate Carnian (Late Triassic). Microfacies analysis and stratigraphic sequences of carbonate rocks in this area show the gradual change of depositional environment from low to high energy conditions.","Thailand","7.1167","100.1667","34566","3.96751341632","105.287057638","2.46945","93.3833"

The early Late Permian (Kubergandian to Midian) Iwaizaki Limestone of the South Kitakami Terrane, situated in Northeast Japan, represents a coral reef complex which was formed on a faulted-bank in an active continental margin. The reef-building organisms include cerioid and dendroid rugose corals, a fasciculate tabulate coral and solenoporacean algae as constructors, calcisponges, bryozoans and crinoids as bafflers, and Tubiphytes, Archaeolithoporella and cyanobacteria as binders. The biotic composition is more diverse than the other coeval reefs. Characterized by the existence of an obvious framework, this reef is similar to the Recent coral reefs and unique among Late Permian reefs, most of which are mainly formed by calcisponges and calcareous algae.

The distribution of Late Permian reefs is closely related to the palaeoclimate. Coral reefs were developed mainly around the South China and Indochina continental masses between the Tethys Sea and the Panthalassa Ocean, in the tropics. While, calcisponge reefs and Tubiphytes-algal crust reefs were common in tropical to subtropical regions, and stromatolite-bryozoan reefs developed in arid areas. The gradational distribution of Late Permian organic reefs including localized development of coral reefs were probably caused by decreasing of the glaciers and changing of the ocean current systems.","Japan","38.8833","141.6","24126","80.5502696868","-164.844416405","22.2463","120.462"

Abstract of ref. 1565:
In the geological record, paleontological taxa of uncertain affinity are receiving increasing attention in order to provide paleoecological data for paleoenvironment reconstructions. The present study deals with the taxon Tubiphytes and analyses some of its synecologic interactions, its role played in influencing community structure and its suspected affinity. Tubiphytes is an important skeletal framework element that occurs in several Lower Permian reef mounds of southern Urals (Russia). Tubiphytes acted as an incrusting, a binding organism and a support for others organisms both in Tratau and Nizhni-Irginsk reef mounds. Tubiphytes is constituted of a dark meshwork, microlaminated, and developed around an internal cavity. Thus, this taxon is restricted to the surrounding envelop. Three morphotypes have been recognized within these buildups, according to the shape and characteristics of their surrounding envelops. Therefore, the internal cavity of Tubiphytes can be represented by a sparitic hole or a preserved organic structure. Two assemblages of Tubiphytes with others organisms can be proved in the Uralian reef mounds: the combination of Tubiphytes with bryozoan zooecial and foraminifer structures.","Russia","53.6167","56.0833","75594","31.71023299","21.8549799196","23.0103","41.8586"

Abstract of ref. 205:
The uppermost Permian Chuenmuping reef formed on the western side of a carbonate platform situated in the eastern Sichuan Basin, southern China. Contrasts exist between this western patch reef and the better known Jiantianba barrier reef complex on the eastern platform margin in western Hubei Province, 250 km to the east. Microbial micritic carbonates form significant components of the Chuenmuping reef limestones. Three types of fabric can be identified: irregular, clotted and scalloped-laminated. An additional, cuneiform fabric has been found only in fore-reef facies at Jiantianba. Irregular fabric is comparable with the surface of presently forming travertines at Rapolano Terme, central Italy, which are produced by calcification of cyanobacteria. Clotted fabric shows indistinct peloids which tend to lack rims, and are amalgated into irregular masses, some of which exhibit bush-like arrangements where traces of filaments can be seen. Traces of filaments are observed in both dark and light layers in the scalloped-laminated fabric, again suggesting a microbial origin. Cuneiform fabric consists of peloids and filaments, and closely resembles deposits in Quaternary travertines which may have been caused by bacterial action. Chuenmuping reef shows a shallowing sequence in normal marine conditions. The micritic fabrics interpreted here as microbial occur more commonly in the upper part of the reef. This indicates that microbial micrities, with a cementing role, formed coevally with reef growth within the upper part of the photic zone.

Abstract of ref. 208:
Permian reefs are widely distributed in the so-called Nanpan Jiang (Nanpan River) region in the neighboring parts of eastern Yunnan, southwestern Guizhou and northwestern Guangxi. Two types of reef occurrences are recognized by their stratigraphic and geographical distributions, 1) a barrier reef belt along a carbonate platform margin and 2) reefs that rim isolated carbonate platforms that occur irregularly within basin facies deposits. The Guangnan reefs of lower Permian age occur within the barrier reef belt and are typical of reefs within the Nanpan Jiang area. These reefs are well-exposed at Dongnameng, a small village about 5 km southeast of Guangnan City and crop out on the west flank on the Guangnan anticline which has been truncated by a major fault. Basin facies deposits occur east of the fault and equivalent carbonate platform deposits occur west of the fault. A succession of reefs  occurs in the late early Permian Maokou Formation and early late Permian Wujiaping Formation. The top of the upper Permian sequence is cut out by faults on the Guangnan anticline and elsewhere is directly overlain by middle Triassic rocks. The preserved upper Permian part may be equivalent to the Wujiaping Formation. The major time of reef development, however, was during early Permian. The reefs have foundations of light gray, thick-bedded, intraclastic-bioclastic grainstones that contain abundant fossils of shallow-water benthic organisms. These limestones represent subtidal bank deposits at the platform margin and functioned as foundations for most of the Permian reefs in the Nanpan Jiang area. Reef limestones consist of light gray, massive, framestones with distinctive textures and abundant fossils. Frame-building organisms are sphinctozoans, inozoans, tabulozoans, bryozoans and hydrozoans. Frame-building organisms total 40-50% of the volume of the reef  masses. Binding organisms are dominantly blue green algae, with subordinate fistuloporid bryozoans and Tubiphytes. Accessory organisms include echinoderms, fusulinids, gastropods, brachiopods, calcareous algae and foraminifers as skeletal debris. The frame-building organisms are generally encrusted by lamellar blue-green algae, which commonly are incorporated fine-grained skeletal fragments. Well developed fibrous calcite cement fills between frame-building organisms to form a typical framestone texture. Gray, thick-bedded, bioclastic packstones and wackestones overlie the  reefs. This stratigraphic relationship suggests that reefs were drowned and that reef development ceased because of the increasing depth. Twelve species of 8 genera of sphinctozoans are described in the present paper. These include: Waagenella salinaria irregularis Zhang, Waagenella sp., Rhabdactinia cf. columnaria Yabe and Sugiyama, Rhabdactinia sp., Intrasporeocoelia hubeienisis Fan and Zhang, Intrasporeocoelia sp., Uvanella guangnanensis sp., nov., Girtycoelia sp., Colospongia cf. dubia Laube, Colospongia sp., Verticillites sp., Lichuanospongia typica Zhang, and of these Uvanella guangnanensis is a new species. Two sizes of sphinctozoans can be differentiated in the collections. The smaller genera include Waagenella, Colospongia, Girtycoelia, and Uvanella. They also make up smaller volumes of the reefs, as compared to the larger forms such as Intrasporeocoelia and Rhabdactinia. The large sphinctozoans are abundant and baffled lime muds during growth of the reefs. All of the sphinctozoans mentioned above also occur in upper Permian reefs of the Lichuan district of west Hubei Province but the diversity in the Nanpan Jiang reefs is much less that in reefs  in the Lichuan district. The sphinctozoan faunas Guangnan may be compared with those of lower Permian reefs in the Bled distric of Yugoslavia.","China","24.0167","105.0833","47455","-0.228258065926","131.786229338","-7.70305","97.8095"

Mainly composed of Archaeolithoporella and Tubiphytes.
Abstract of ref. 1327:
Tubiphytes and Archaeolithoporella are two important building calcareous algae in Permian reefs, especially in the Upper Murghabian of Jebel Tebaga (Tunisia). Systematics of the two algae (probably blue-green) is reviewed.
Tubiphytes and Archaeolithoporella were previously poorly known in the Upper Permian beds from Jebel Tebaga. These algae, always associated, take a prominent part in the building of the reefs. The analysis of the reefs, 20 m thick and 60 m wide, shows the following biological sequence: a) Prereefal first stage: settling of clay-marly sediments including several calcareous organisms, mainly Calcisponges and Bivalves. b) Second stage: Whole organisms or
remains are encrusted by a first generation of the stromatolitic algae Archaeolithoporella, which will be colonized in a second time by the blue-green algae Tubiphytes. The former, rapidly attached, show a growth which follow the exact shape of the anfractuosites of Archaeolithoporella laminae. Open spaces and cavities created by the growth of alga assemblages are progressively filled by an internal micritic sediment with pellets. This open space filling by a fine material suggests a growth of Tubiphytes in restricted conditions, where the luminosity is lessen, indicating a sciaphilous alga. c) Third stage: Attachment and proliferation of a second generation of dense Archaeolithoporella.
    They encrust Tubiphytes and other substrates, growing laterally and vertically. The crusts of Archaeolithoporella are parallel to the substrate at the beginning of the growth, but a few millimeters higher appears a mammillated crust, which gives, at the end of the growth, some nodules with concentric laminations, often trapped in interstitial micritic fills.
 These nodules are called here tebagites. This biologic sequence occurs repeatly from the bottom to the top of the reef. Furthermore, examination of relations between the growth of Archaeolithoporella and the early diagenetic features (cements) allows to establish, in addition to the biologic sequence, a diagenetic sequence summarized as following: -
    growth of dense micritic laminae. - Growth of clear and dark laminae (i.e. typical stage). - Growth of vesicular laminae filled by fibrous or botryoidal cement. - Stop of algae growth, followed by a filling of the interalgal porosity with a botryoidal cement or an internal peloidal sediment. In conclusion, Tubiphytes and Archaeolithoporella constitute the main building organisms of the studied reefs. Identical assemblages are known from the Lower Permian of Carnic Alps,
from Upper Permian of Yugoslavia and Capitan Reef in U.S.A. as well, under the name of Calcisponges/Algal/Cements

Abstract of ref. 232:
The Upper Permian of Jameson Land includes two carbonate sequences, the Karstryggen and Wegener Halvo formations. The Karstryggen Formation contains hypersaline carbonates and localized evaporites that were heavily weathered and dissected prior to deposition of the overlying strata. The overlying Wegener Halvo Formation represents an abrupt and extensive marine inundation over the underlying karstified Karstryggen surface. Bryozoan-brachiopod-algal-cement buildups of the Wegener Halvo Formation are localized on karstic highs, and show up to 150 m of depositional relief. In-situ mound-core deposits are flanked by allodapic limestones, which pass laterally into intermound calcareous shales.
The diagenetic histories of the core and flank facies are very different. Core facies porosity was intially obliterated by marine cements, but repeated meteoric exposure altered unstable core facies constituents. This alteration produced extensive secondary porosity through grain and cement leaching with local collapse brecciation. Flank strata, however, underwent little sea-floor diagenesis, and low permeability and mineralogically stable grain composition protected these strata from meteoric alteration.
Early cementation and stabilization of core strata led to minimal burial-diagenetic porosity loss. Uncemented flank beds, however, underwent profound mechanical and chemical compaction during this stage. Thus, at the time of hydrocarbon generation, distal flank beds had less than 2% porosity, coarse upper flank beds had 5-10% remnant primary porosity, and core facies deposits had 8-12% secondary pore space.
Hydrocarbons generated from surrounding marine shales charged many of the bioherms with oil. Subsequent fracturing and hydrothermal fluid flow, however, flushed hydrocarbons and filled pores with ferroan calcite, barite, fluorite, galena, and baroque dolomite. This heating and flushing is thought to have been especially intense in the Wegener Halvo region. Thus, more basinal areas may still have reservoirs containing significant oil in equivalent Upper Permian limestones.
If, as is likely, the sea level changes affecting the Greenland Permian were eustatic, then this study may provide significant clues to porosity development throughout the largely unexplored northern Zechstein basin and the Arctic basin of the Barent Sea. This study also provides some important connections to the probably time-equivalent Guadalupian carbonate reservoir rocks of west Texas-New Mexico and Wyoming.","Denmark","71.7167","-23","","30.3855093477","10.7708866701","27.8705","17.2359"

Abstract of ref. 261:
The plate-shaped calcareous hydrozoan ? Palaeoaplysina Krotov is the main fossil in Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian carbonate buildups in the Lemhi Range and Arco Hills of east-central Idaho (USA) Palaeoaplysina has an internal subparallel canal system imbedded in cellular tissue, and mamelon-like surface protuberances. Other fossils in the buildups include the calcareous phylloid alga Eugonophyllum, other unidentified phylloid algae, crustose bryozoans, and less common gastropods, crinoids, and brachiopods. Buildup sediment accumulated primarily by the baffling and entrapment of loose carbonate pellets, lime mud, and skeletal fragments in protected pockets and hollows
between Palaeoaplysina and algal plates. There is a continuum between tabular and lenticular buildup geometries.
    Broad tabular buildups are typically 2-10 m thick and as much as 15 km wide. The basal surfaces of the tabular
buildups conform to previous sea-floor topography, whereas upper surfaces are relatively flat and planar, suggesting that the buildups were limited in upward growth because they formed in the uppermost subtidal zone. The abundance of porcelaneous tubular foraminifers (resembling apterrinellids and Hedraites), which encrusted some unpreserved organisms, suggests that some buildups were carpeted by unfossilized vegetation such as noncalcareous algae. Strongly
lenticular buildups are typically 2-16 m thick and a few tens to hundreds of meters wide. Most were large enough to modify depositional conditions nearby, resulting in fore-mound and back-mound beds. All of the lenticular buildups, and some of the tabular ones, stood topographically above the adjacent sea floor while they formed. Some buildups are stacked one above another. Others are in offlapping sequences which also include lenticular beds of crinoidal-bryozoan lime wackestone and grainstone.","United States","43.8167","-112.7833","","9.29538826575","-56.4648439256","11.2771","-37.5885"

Topographically, the southern half of Somalia is comparatively flat, with elevations of < 350 m above sea level. The northern half of the country rises northward to an elevation of 2000 m, where it drops off sharply to the Gulf of Aden. All of Somalia was a peneplain at the end of Paleozoic time. Jurassic limestone then was deposited uniformly over the entire country, but post-Jurassic erosion removed a considerable thickness of these rocks, locally exposing basement. A Cretaceous sea then covered all of Somalia. Transgressions and regressions took place during Cretaceous time, and locally the Cretaceous is disconformable with the overlying Eocene. Marine Eocene sedimentary rocks cover the northern half of Somalia, but are absent in southern Somalia except for a narrow strip along the coast where marine Eocene is present in the subsurface together with marine Oligocene, Miocene and Pliocene, the latter present locally in outcrops. Southern Somalia was subjected to epeirogenic uplift at the end of Cretaceous time and has remained above sea level ever since, except in the coastal areas. The rift faulting of middle and late Tertiary time uplifted the northern half of the country with the result that post-Eocene marine sedimentary rocks are known only along a narrow strip of the coast. There is no evidence of major compressive folding in Somalia, but northeast-southwest-trending anticlines of gentle dip have been mapped in Tertiary rocks in the north and identified in the subsurface in central and southern Somalia. The structures apparently were caused either by rejuvenation of Jurassic fault blocks causing arching of younger sediments, or by leaching of thick underlying evaporites. The most promising region for oil and gas prospecting in Somalia is the Mesozoic shelf and reef area around the Somali embayment and around the Nogal uplift. Secondary prospective oil and gas regions in Somalia are the coastal and offshore marine Tertiary sedimentary rocks. Stratigraphic traps in clastic sedimentary rocks caused by facies changes or overlaps against the uplift regions of Somalia, and monoclinal porosity pinchouts in carbonate sedimentary rocks are other possibilities. Commercial oil and gas deposits are probably present in Somalia.

Abstract of ref. 315:
The Late Pennsylvanian Yucca Mound complex is a carbonate buildup on the western side of the Sacramento shelf facing the Oro Grande basin, in south-central New Mexico (USA). This complex is an accumulation of algal and foraminiferal boundstones and phylloid-algal packstones and wackestones which were subjected to several periods of subaerial exposure. The growth history of this organic complex is related closely to late Paleozoic cyclic sedimentation in a tectonically active area, and is thought to be the result of progressive offlapping growth stages down the western
flank of the active La Luz anticline. The oldest beds exposed in the complex (plumose masses of algal and foraminiferal boundstone) formed within wave base on the crest of an earlier organic buildup. The crest of the older buildup was subaerially expised while a thick accumulation of carbonate mud replete with the phylloid algae, Ivanovia, started forming against its western (seaward) flank. As sea level rose and submerged the earlier mound, the phylloid-algal accumulation kept pace with sea-level rise and onlapped the older mound, despite a few brief interruptions. When the phylloid algae built up into wave base, and attained its climax stage of evolution, a typical shallow-water facies developed. This distinctive rock type on the preserved, rounded mound top contains abundant forams, both encrusting and mobile chambered forms, together with fish remains and corodonts. A bedded detrital flank facies, composed of
broken phylloid-algal material, and concentrated remains of forams, fish, and conodonts that inhabited the upper
mound, is present on the shelfward (lee) side of the complex. Abundant, algally coated skeletal grains characterize the flank facies, which is easily recognizable elsewhere within the area, mainly in mound-flanking beds.

The Permian Capitan reef of the Guadalupe Mountains was
  bound, lithified, and preserved by microbially precipitated micrite. A microbial origin or association is based on the distribution, texture, fossil content, and order of microstratigraphic succession. In samples from the
  middle Capitan Formation, micrite layers (about 1 cm thick) encrusted the top, sides, and undersides of in situ organisms and also piled above organisms in thick (0.5 to > 3 cm) accumulations, with high angles of repose (up to 90°). Primary encrustations commonly consist of thin, homogeneous, subparallel layers of Archaeolithoporella---interpreted to be
  a red alga that probably lived in dimly lit cavities. Secondary encrustations (0.5--30 mm thick) contain 10--50 µm diameter peloids and fossil cyanophytes, and are usually bound by thin layers of micrite. Secondary encrustations of gravity-defying peloidal micrites are interpreted as having precipitated within mucilaginous microbial aggregations, probably in dark
  cavities. The secondary microbial micrites were followed by
  cavity-filling, aragonitic botryoids. Thin (< 1 mm) layers of clotted micrite were deposited on the first botryoids, probably by microbial biofilms. 

  In contrast to samples from the middle Capitan Formation, samples from the upper Capitan Formation taken near the transition from reef to outer shelf are composed of smaller (1--2 mm) framework organisms and are bound by layers of thinner (< 1 mm) primary encrustations. In the upper Capitan Formation samples, dense, clotted micrite forms secondary encrustations (£ 1 mm thick), commonly underneath primary framework.
  Secondary encrustations are succeeded by more abundant tertiary encrustations (1--4 mm thick) of sparse, clotted micrite with vague dendritic structures. The secondary and tertiary encrustations are interpreted as microbial. The samples from the upper Capitan Formation were deposited in the shallowest part of the reef (< 1 to 10 m deep), and most of the samples from the middle Capitan were deposited in deep water  (10--140 m). The difference in the encrustations and in the overall scale of  the two fabrics is probably related to differences in environmental energy   during deposition.","United States","32.1667","-104.4333","47714","5.45785477956","-36.7948202879","4.43781","-32.8287"

Abstract of ref. 1455:
A previously undocumented example of aragonite botryoid formation on the sea floor is described from shallow-water Wolfcampian (Permian) phylloid algal mounds in the Sacramento Mountains of New Mexico. The cores of these mounds consisted of botryoidal aragonite masses that stood in low relief on the sea floor. The upward growth and coalescence of these masses created a solid, anastomosing framework of inter-botyroid and internal cavities that were simultaneously filled with marine sediment and aragonite fan cements. The resulting inorganic boundstone became the substrate for later phylloid algal mound development. Subsequent algal colonization and contemporaneous aragonite precipitation also resulted in the development of a mixed inorganic-organic facies in which algal blades are encased in marine aragonite. Former aragonite constitutes from 50-85% of the total mound rock. The core facies of these inorganic 'reefs' are texturally and, most probably, genetically similar to the many Paleozoic mudmounds throughout the world known as Waulsortian mounds, Stromatactis reefs and zebra limestones. The former marine aragonite is represented by divergent-radial mosaics of coarsely crystalline calcite pseudospar that are commonly replaced by ferroan 'baroque' dolomite. This pseudospar occurs as ray-crystals and composite crystals with included relicts of the precursor fibrous aragonite. This species of calcite is distinct from the radiaxial-fibrous mosaics that commonly replace acicular carbonate fabrics. Mineralogic stabilization of the aragonite to calcite via paramorphic inversion is believed to have occurred in the subaerial environment, with recrystallization to pseudospar occurring in the subsurface. Unresolved problems include the mechanics of fabric-retentive stabilization diagenesis of this aragonite, and the apparent anomaly of aragonite abundance in contrast to Holocene reefs, in which Mg-calcite is the dominant cement mineralogy.","United States","33.1","-105.9833","34658","-2.39645219462","-56.523481404","-1.40447","-37.3299"

Abstract ref. 314:
In northeast Oklahoma, the Mississippian Boone formation contains numerous striking bioherms composed of crinoidal debris. Most of the exposed bioherms occur in the St. Joe, or lowest member of the Boone formation. The Reeds Spring, or middle member, contains no bioherms, and the Keokuk, or upper member, contains a few known bioherms. The bioherms occur in widespread, thin-bedded crinoidal limestones and are related in origin to the thin-bedded limestones. Each bioherm consists of a lens-shaped core of massive limestone which is surrounded by and interfingers with thin-bedded limestones. The massive cores are 10-40 feet thick and 50-1,000 feet wide. The thin-bedded limestones dip steeply away from the massive cores.

The bioherms are interpreted as having been formed by the accentuated growth and accumulation of crinoids. The bioherms formed mounds which were elevated as much as 50 feet above the floor of a shallow sea. The massive bioherm cores were probably created by the continuous deposition of crinoidal debris. Whereas the bedded limestones represent deposition which was interrupted from time to time. The thin-bedded limestones on the flanks of bioherms were deposited on slopes as steep as 45°. A debris-binding agent, such as inorganically precipitated calcium carbonate or calcareous algae, is postulated to have bound the deposits of crinoidal debris together, permitting them to persist on such steep slopes. The bioherms are considered to have been organic reefs because they formed wave- esistant organic structures which formed elevated prominences in a shallow sea.","United States","36.4","-95","5614","-10.4089620899","-97.6885715588","-22.1236","-41.9235"

Abstract of ref 322:
The Liassic Madreporaria from Morocco, collected in the reef and subreef formations of the High and Middle-Atlas are described in the present Monograph. 40 new species are found among the 69 species described. These species belong to 43 genera already known and to 11 new genera. The 10 genera already present in the Triassic do not persist beyond the Domerian. The twenty-five genera which were previously known in the Dogger, the Malm and even the Cretaceous and which appear in the Middle or in the Upper Liassic are not present earlier than the Pliensbachian. This stratigraphical range allows to distinguish three biozones in the Liassic of Morocco: -The Lower Liassic (Hettangien and Sinemurian stages) is characterized by triassic genera and liassic ones which do not do up the Dogger. In the Middle Liassic (Pliensbachian or Carixian and Domerian) are found both triassic and liassic genera and genera which just appear and which live up to the Dogger, the Malm and even to the Cretaceous. In the Upper Liassic (Toarcian and Aalenian) all the triassic genera are disappeared, the genera are very similar to those of the middle Jurassic but essentially liassic genera are still present in this level. The presence in this fauna of triassic genera created by CUIF and of forms till known from the Bajocian to Senonian allows the author to lay a new taxonomy which assembles the    classification of CUIF (1976) respecting the triassic Scleractinia and the oldest classifications of VAUGHAN & WELLS (1943), WELLS (1956) and Alloiteau (1952 and 1957) till now used for the mesozoic Madreporaria. This new taxonomy is based both on skeleton microstructures (CUIF) and on other anatomic characters which are the evidence of an evolution in the microstructure and in the arrangement of the trabeculae.","Morocco","32.5","-1.9833","33572","26.0031634641","8.69031917393","25.0649","-3.05944"

Type section of Waulsortian mounds

Abstract of ref. 2157:
The biostratigraphy and sedimentology of the late Tournaisian, Waulsortian buildups of the type area, at Waulsort (Belgium), are examined in detail. Four buildups are present. Overall, they span the stratigraphic interval from the  base of the Ivorian stage to the lower part of the Moliniacian stage, ending just below the base of the Viséan.

Petrographic study shows that all Waulsortian Phases are represented, the older buildups being of Phases A and B, whereas the youngest ranges through Phases A to D. The relatively crude Phase classification is refined by correspondence analysis, which shows that the grain types present in the Waulsortian and associated limestones conform closely to the relay (systematic shift of relative importance of grain types) described from other Waulsortian buildups in Belgium.
 A Relay Index, derived from the correspondence analysis and defining the position of each sample in the compositional relay, is plotted on stratigraphic logs of the sections studied to allow detailed comparison with other Waulsortian and peri-Waulsortian sections in the Dinant area for which similar curves already exist. The Waulsort buildups are found to fit closely into the depositional and palaeobathymetric patterns established or suspected in the area. Two shallowing upward sequences seem to be present, separated by an abrupt deepening. The earlier, relatively minor shallowing trend, in the Polygnathus communis carina Zone, is here recorded in buildup facies
 for the first time: previous evidence had come from the laterally equivalent facies. The other shallowing trend, which extends through the Scaliognathus anchoralis Zone and culminates near the base of the Moliniacian stage, is the regional, late Tournaisian regression which had a major influence on the biota of the Waulsortian banks in Belgium and was probably largely responsible for cessation of bank growth over most of the area.","Belgium","50.1667","4.8667","76920","-2.04546711671","-48.6383746488","-13.9205","4.50167"

Abstract ref. 2012:
   Spectacular phylloid algal reefs of Virgilian and Wolfcampian age occur in the Hueco Mountains, Texas. These are dominated by the erect, recumbent or
cyathiform chlorophyte genera Eugonophyllum and Ivanovia. 
     Such reefs have long been considered as ecologically simple communities, that lack dominant framebuilders, but contain substantial volumes of micrite. As a result,
the dominant constructional mechanism for reef formation has been inferred to be sediment baffling and trapping, mainly by erect phylloid algae. However, detailed
analysis of growth framework clearly shows that these algae were in fact capable of forming a rigid framework. Phylloid algae, together with the problematicum
Tubiphytes/Shamovella and the red alga (?) Archaeolithoporella, formed complex, multiple encrustations (both in-vivo and post-mortem) and were a fundamental
element of reef construction. Furthermore, crypts formed by Eugonophyllum, were frequently colonised by pendant Tubiphytes/Shamovella encrustations. Typically,
crypt-dwellers were smaller and less well developed than their open surface representatives. This demonstrates the limited longevity of such crypts before their
occlusion by internal reef sediments and early marine cements. 
     Synchronous gamete production and release is demonstrated for Eugonophyllum individuals and colonies. By analogy with modern relatives such as Halimeda and
Udotea, Eugonophyllum colonies suffered post-reproductive mass-death. This is due to holocarpic reproduction, where the plant undergoes simultaneous conversion
of the entire cell contents into gametes. The life cycle of Eugonophyllum may therefore be split into three phases: 1. Rapid colonisation of substrate by settlement of a
limited number of zygotes. 2. Growth and calcification of the plants. 3. Sexual reproduction and resulting mass-death of the plants. The resulting algal detritus is an
important sediment component in both the reef and surrounding off-reef facies. The amount of carbonate production due to these phylloid algae is probably similar to
the reported values for modern Halimeda, where a modest vegetation density of 1 kg/m2 produces calcareous sediment at a rate of 2 kg/m2/yr. Therefore,
construction of these Palaeozoic algal reefs is due to many superimposed communities representing repeated, self-seeded colonisation. The Eugonophyllum plants
themselves grew within a rapidly lithifying, micritic substrate. Indeed, such rapid seafloor cementation was clearly essential for reef formation and may have provided
a mechanism of substrate attachment for the Eugonophyllum plants. 
     These observations show that reef formation can arise from many different mechanisms resulting in in-situ carbonate production and therefore complex feedback
controls are important determinants of reef fabric. However, much remains to be understood as to the relative importance of constructional versus destructional
processes in ancient reefs. Careful application of uniformitarian models to these reefs is required. From a biological viewpoint, uniformitarian models may be invoked
in determining the life history of phylloid algae. However, from a geochemical viewpoint, rates of cementation and seawater chemistry in these icehouse reefs are
likely to be very different to present-day conditions. Therefore, many of the processes involved in the construction of these algal reefs may be unique to these
Palaeozoic reefs.","United States","31.8167","-106.0333","50814","-2.6220420833","-53.6572851644","-1.33865","-37.4428"

Abstract ref. 1596:
The studied reefs are situated around the Cameros Basin (Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, North Spain) in a rim of marine Jurassic outcrops. The last marine Jurassic sediments in the area are characterized by the development of coral reefs which correspond to the Kimmeridgian. These reefs were situated in an epicontinental seaway which lay between the Iberian and Ebro massives. This sequence is best exposed near Torrecilla en Cameros where a fringing reef has been identified. In each buildup of this reef complex, the reef-core, with a fore-reef and longshore carbonate sand bars can be distinguished. The reef complex in Soria has a different geometry for vertical growth dominates, although some progradation occurs and a back reef grainstone facies prograded over the core reef facies. Many diagenetic processes have affected these reefs although cementation is particularly important because it has provided a clear paragenetic sequence related to the diagenetic evolution of these limestones. The most common sequence evolves from submarine cements (only present in primary cavities) to cements precipitated under active fresh-water phreatic conditions, stagnant phreatic afterwards, and finally under burial conditions. This sequence represents progressive burial of these reefs when a very thick serie of essentially continental sediments was deposited. Another less common sequence is present in some dissolution cavities generated in the subsurface. This sequence evolved from cements precipitated in a reduced burial environment to shallower oxidizing ones precipitated under telodiagenetic conditions.","Spain","42.2333","-2.6333","34624","27.1098900301","11.8708976618","33.9384","7.78141"

Abstract of Ref. 1848:
Although skeletal organisms have received most of the emphasis in studies on Phanerozoic reef history, the roles of non-skeletal (non-enzymatic) carbonates (e.g., synsedimentary cements, automicrite, microbialite, etc.) in reef framework construction are becoming increasingly better understood. One problem in understanding the role of non-enzymatic carbonates in reef construction has been the difficulty in recognizing them in reef facies. Whereas skeletal organisms commonly can be recognized and documented in the field, non-enzymatic carbonates may be recognizable only in thin section. This paper describes the application of a new sampling technique that allows the quantitative comparison of skeletal macrofauna and flora with associated non-enzymatic carbonates and other microfaunal/microfloral constituents. The technique involves the point counting of thin sections made from small diameter cores that are systematically recovered from grids and line transects that cover a reasonable area (m2) of reef facies. Small, shallow-water patch reefs are abundant in scattered oolitic intervals in the Lower Carboniferous strata of eastern Australia. The youngest known Carboniferous reefs in eastern Australia occur in uppermost Visean strata (limestone FC5) near the top of the Rockhampton Group, approximately 50 km west-northwest of Rockhampton, Queensland. The largest sampled reef was 15 m thick and 42 m in diameter, with synsedimentary relief above the sea floor of at least 2 m during the primary growth phase. The reef occurs within bioclastic-oolitic grainstones representing a shallow shelf setting and consists of eight common framework microfacies: 1) coral boundstone. 2) bryozoan boundstone. 3) mixed crinoid-bryozoan boundstone. 4) tubular problematica boundstone. 5) sponge-automicrite boundstone. 6) encrusted thrombolite boundstone. 7) mixed automicrite boundstone. and 8) thrombolitic wackestone-packstone. Reef growth was initiated by automicrite-producing biofilms, sponges and a tubular problematic organism. Primary relief building was accomplished by automicrite-dominated frameworks and lithistid sponges, crinoids, and corals. Large cerioid Aphrophyllum coral colonies had a heterogeneous distribution through the reef. The framework of the main relief-bearing portion of the reef consists on average of 44.4 % automicrite and automicrite-bound detritus, excluding automicrite-bound sponge body fossils, and at most 19.6 % skeletal organisms in growth position (minimum of 7.2 %). If sponge body fossils are included as automicrite framework, because they are preserved only as a result of automicrite formation, the percentage of automicrite and bound sediment is 54.9 %. A smaller sampled reef consisting of the same basic facies had 39.5 % automicrite and automicrite-bound sediment in its framework (50.2 % including sponges) and, at most, 33.4 % skeletal organisms in growth position (minimum of 22.7 %). The greater volume of skeletal framework in the small reef reflects a greater proportion of large corals. Of frame-building skeletal organisms, automicrite-preserved lithistid and other sponges and cerioid rugose corals provided the greatest volume. However, crinoid holdfasts were the most widespread skeletal framework components. The dominant framework facies are sponge-automicrite boundstone, encrusted thrombolite boundstone, mixed automicrite boundstone, and coral boundstone. The reefs are similar in overall framework construction and ecological succession to slightly older Visean reefs in eastern Australia and to some of the late Visean reefs of northern England. Surprisingly, framework similarities also exist between the reefs and certain thrombolite-lithistid-coral reefs of the European Jurassic.","Australia","-23.3833","150.4","24197","-36.5609766298","130.559071191","-36.265","146.648"

Abstract of ref. 407:
Upper Jurassic reefs rich in microbial crusts generally appear in deeper (sponge - 'algal' crust reefs) or in very shallow but protected settings (coral or coral-coralline sponge meadows with 'algal' crusts). UpperJurassic high energy reefs (coral reefs and coral-stromatoporoid reefs) normally lack major participation of microbial crusts but rather represent huge bioclastic piles with only minor framestone patches preserved. 

An exception to this rule is represented by the high energy, coral-'algal' Ota Reef from the Kimmeridgian of the Lusitanian Basin (Portugal) . The narrow Ota Reef tract rims a small intra-basinal carbonate platform exhibiting perfect facies zonation (from W to E: Reef tract, back reef sands, peritidal belt, low-energy shallow lagoon) . The reef is dominated by massive corals (Thamnasteria, Microsolena, Stylina). Complete preservation of coral framework is rare: like other Upper Jurassic high-energy reefs, the Ota Reef is very rich in debris. However, this debris is largely stabilized by algal and microbial crusts, what contrasts the other examples and gives the Ota Reef the appearance of a typical modem high-energy coral-melobesioid algal reef. Further similarities to modern reefs are the likely existence of a spur-and-groove system, the perfect sheltering of inner platform areas and the occurrence of small islands, as indicated by local blackenings and early vadose and karstic features. 

The exceptional character of the Ota Reef is thought to be due to the establishment of an equilibrated sediment balance. In a modern high-energy reef, physical and bio logical genereration of debris is compensated by 
(1) stabilization of loose debris by binding organisms, chiefly melobesioid algae,
(2) accelerated coral-growth in order to keep pace with sedimentation, and
(3) export of surplus material into back reef and fore reef areas through wave action. Since during the Late Jurassic, fast growing corals were rare and only less effective microbial binders were available, sediment balance could normally not be achieved in a comparable high-energy setting. This resulted in the increasing loss of stable bottom due to sedimentation and eventual suffocation of reef patches. However, in the Ota example the existence of a steep by-pass margin accounted for equilibrated sediment balance: 
(1) Along the steep margin additional gravitational export was possible. 
(2) The steepness of the margin kept the reef tract narrow, so that it could be well winnowed by a longshore current system along the east side of the basin. 
(3) The remaining loose debris could, to a large extent, be stabilized by the available algal-like and microbial binders (thrombolitic-peloidal crusts, Bacinella, Lithocodium, Thaumatoporella, Tubiphytes).","Portugal","39.0667","-9","25327","27.4790992545","5.38680283466","33.5759","0.849693"

Abstract of ref. 432:
During the Late Oxfordian and Middle Kimmeridgian (Late Jurassic), small patch  reefs were formed at numerous localities in northern Germany. The richly structured neritic sea was characterized by seasonally varying environmental factors, such as water movement and illumination as ecological requisites, and sedimentological conditions and bioerosion as ecological addends. These factors evidently affect the faunas. Thus, a palaeontological facies interpretation is possible according to qualitative and quantitative criteria supported by sedimentological results. Twenty six species of reef corals are described in detail and arranged in various guilds (builders, bafflers, binders, dwellers) on the basis of the impact of growth forms on the skeletal frame. However, intraspecific variation of guild membership may occur due to different reefal architecture. The most important synecological parameters, dominance and diversity, are calculated for all localities. Thamnasteria concinna (GOLDFUSS) which can tolerate partial mortality well is the dominant species in various environments, thus showing ubiquitous characteristics. The diversities of the associations examined are generally low and strongly vary within comparable facies. This fact proves the oscillation of important environmental factors. Despite the ecological preferences of some taxa, the distribution of reef corals seems to be mostly random, at least in more favourable environments.","Germany","52.2083","9.1333","23924","37.6215580279","25.7017313219","43.235","17.3066"

Abstract of ref. 459:
Patch reefs, up to 4 metres high and 8 metres across, grew amongst oolith shoals at the top of the Portland Limestone Formation (Portlandian, Upper Jurassic) on the Isle of Portland, southern England. Principal reef framebuilders, which provided between 55 and 70 per cent of the reef volume, were cementing bivalves, solenoporacean algae, and bryozoans. The remaining pore-space in the reef was filled by sediment, most of which is in the form of a precipitated peloidal cement. The cement lithified the reef while it was still exposed on the sea floor, and was probably precipitated under bacterial control. A diverse accessory fauna of small cementing encrusters and nestlers includes groups such as terebratulid brachiopods and lithistid sponges that have not previously been found in the Portland Limestone. Serpula (Cycloserpula) striatissima sp. nov. and Carterochaena pulcherrima gen. et sp. nov. are described. Both the primary organic framework of the reef and the submarine cements were bored by a variety of endoliths, which locally removed as much as 40 per cent of the reef volume.

Abstract ref. 465:
Serpulidae (Polychaeta) are benthic, suspension-feeding worms, mostly marine, secreting their own calcareous habitation tubes. Serpulid 'reefs' include banks deposited on shallow parts of continental shelves, and primary frame reefs  at intertidal and subtidal depths. Sheltered bays harbour the largest reefs, up to a few metres in height and kilometres in length. A review of habitats with Recent serpulid mass-occurrences allows interpretation of the palaeoenvironment in which the serpulid limestones in the 'Upper Malm' (Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous) of NW Germany may have been laid down. The Lower Serpulid Limestones represent concentrations of re-deposited serpulid tubes. In the Upper Serpulid Limestones ('Serpulit') the re-deposited tubes are embedded in stromatolitic algae. Both limestones were formed in lagoons fringing an inland sea. Several records of Recent and fossil 'serpulid' buildups are erroneous and can be referred to algae, vermiform 'gastropods' or non-serpulid polychaetes. Differences and similarities between calcareous tubes of serpulids and vermetids (Gastropoda) are summarized.","Germany","52.25","9.5667","25150","38.597583885","23.7618744483","43.88","17.1856"

Detailed field work has allowed to recognize eight main facies associations which reflect various depositional environments, and which document a differentiated zonation, from the inner platform to the basin. A shallow lagoon existed in the internal part of the Gargano Promontory with a transition to tidal flat areas (F1). Oolitic shoals (F2) bordered this internal peritidal area passing seaward to a reef-flat with abundant corals (F3). A reef-front, associated with a coral rubble zone, has been found in some areas (F4). In the external margin zone, massive wackestones with Ellipsactinia occur (F5) and pass gradually to a rudstone facies on the proximal slope (F6). The base-of-slope facies association consists of pelagic sediments interbedded with gravity-displaced deposits (F7 and F8). The depositional profile of the Apulia Platform is typical of the Tethyan Jurassic-Early Cretaceous platforms, with slope declivities in the order of 25 degree -28 degree . The remarkable progradation of the platform in the northern tract of the Gargano (Lesina and Varano lakes area) and its substantial stability east- and southwards (Mattinata area) suggest a possible windward position of the margin in this latter portion and, in contrast, a leeward position of the northern portion.","Italy","41.5","16.08","","18.2953830424","22.8304812295","27.8957","19.7662"

Abstract of ref. 651:
Small and isolated Messinian patch reefs showing a typical internal succession and an oligospecific reef-building community are described from the western margin of the San Miguel de Salinas Basin (SE Spain). These thrived in a mixed carbonate- siliciclastic environment and are known from two different stratigraphic levels. The reef growth is characterized by a shallowing-upward sequence and can be subdivided into four divisions: reef debris zone; coralline algal zone; branching coral zone; and reef crest zone. This ecological succession of Messinian reefs reflects an increasing water turbulence and the accommodation of the reef-building organisms to shallower-water settings, which is conditioned by its own upward growth. The start of reef growth is controlled by a reduced influx of terrigenous deposits, which derived from fan sediments reworked by waves. The reefs were killed by smothering with quartzose calcarenites. The low diversity of the reef-building community indicates an arrested ecological succession without climax stages, controlled by sedimentation rate and siliciclastic supply. A salinity increase can be excluded, because the reef- associated fauna indicates normal-marine conditions during reef growth. There is no evidence for subaerial exposure of the reefs during the formation of evaporites at the end of the Messinian.","Spain","38","-1.0167","69812","37.7422800467","-1.08858095734","38.1394","-1.55154"

Abstract of ref. 1403
Bivalves are conspicuous and important components in the Messinian Nijar reef, a fringing reef which developed on the northern margin of the Almeria-Nijar Neogene basin in southeastern Spain. Bivalves appear in four distinct taphofacies that coincide with the facies and subfacies belts in which the reef has previously been divided: (1) In the reef core (Taphofacies 1) well-preserved, crevice-inhabitants occur. Sand- to gravel-sized bivalve fragments re included in the matrix that fills the framework voids. (2) Bivalve bioclasts appear in gravels surrounding reef-framework blocks in Taphofacies 2. Sheltering among blocks diminished breakage of shells, pointing to a hydraulic origin of shell reworking and fragmentation in this upper part of the slope. The recognizable fragments belong to bissally-attached, cemented, and endobenthic forms. Endolithic, and some cemented and endosedimentary bivalves remain in life position. (3) Bivalves are found in Taphofacies 3 as clasts in  debris-flow breccias and constitute allochthonous assemblages coming downslope from the reef- talus. They also appear as sand- to gravel-sized particles in the calcarenites intercalating the breccias and only a few unbroken and sometimes articulated examples are considered to be autochthonous /parautochthonous in this environment. (4) Scarce, not fragmented, deep-water oysters are dispersed in the fine-grained sediments of the distal slope. The number of bivalve species is very low compared with the species richness of modern coral reefs and most of the recorded taxa have a present-day temperature distribution. All this supports the hypothesis of the marginal biogeographical character of the western Mediterranean Messinian reefs.","Spain","36.95","-2.2167","69787","36.6151601083","-2.32948660518","37.1258","-2.92849"

Abstract of ref.  551:
The Late Paleocene Salt Mountain Limestone from southwestern Alabama (USA) is a coral-algal-sponge buildup which further characterizes the faunal makeup of early post-Cretaceous reefs. Thin sectioning has disclosed a variety of lithologies, including large foram-algal packstone, algal bindstone, and sponge bafflestone. A low-diversity fauna of massive scleractinian corals caps the sequence, but may be developed intermittently throughout the section as well. The constructional importance of coralline algae and the low diversity of scleractinian corals are characteristic of Paleocene reefs in general. Sponges, however, are virtually unknown in earliest Tertiary sediments. Their abundance in the Salt Mountain demonstrates not only their local contribution to Early Tertiary reefs, but may also reflect an opportunistic response of sponges as reef constructors following the extinction of oligotrophic, rudist-coral reef communities of the Late Cretaceous. 

Abstract ref. 2185:
The slow recovery of reef coral communities after the K-T extinctions has long been recognized, but the scarcity of Paleocene corals and reefs has inhibited study of early Tertiary reef diversification. A key question regarding this recovery concerns the extent to which changes in coral diversity affect the establishment of coral reef communities. Specifically, is the scarcity of Paleocene reefs the result of low coral diversity? We examined this question through investigations of the oldest Paleocene reef from the Gulf of Mexico region (the Salt Mountain Limestone) and newly revised generic level occurrence data for the Caribbean. The Salt Mountain Limestone is a Thanetian (Late Paleocene) shallow water patch reef in southern Alabama. It contains 12 species of reef corals including massive and platy zooxanthellate forms co-occurring with abundant branching-nodular apozooxanthellate species. The species richness and ecology of this Paleocene fauna approximates that of later Tertiary and modern reef communities from the northern Gulf of Mexico. Unlike younger reefs, however, the Salt Mountain reef community is dominated not by corals, but by coralline algae and a diverse group of hexactinellid sponges. Thus, Paleocene corals were comparable to later faunas, but the reef community was not. Looking at generic records, 23 reef coral genera are known from or range through the Caribbean Paleocene. This is lower than the number known from the later Tertiary and modern Caribbean, but only slightly so. There are numerous examples of later Tertiary coral reefs composed of fewer genera suggesting that lower taxonomic richness was not the primary reason for the lack of Paleocene coral build-ups. The absence of coral reefs was more likely the result of a break-down in coral-algal symbiosis or the lack of a few key taxa that structure Tertiary through Recent reef communities.","United States","31.4333","-87.9167","34652","35.7951480314","-72.1104287713","34.2027","-69.9223"

Abstract ref. 1244:
Recent exploration activity in the Salawati basin, along the northwestern tip of Iran Jaya, Indonesia, resulted in significant oil discoveries. Reservoir and trap are provided by highly porous and permeable Miocene reef rocks which yielded oil at rates of up to 32,000 bbl/day from individual wells. The Salawati basin is a structural-stratigraphic basin containing more than 4600 m of marine Tertiary sedimentary deposits. The basin is bounded on the north by the Sorong fault zone which separates the Australian continental plate from the Pacific oceanic plate. Basin development was initiated in the Miocene when local downwarping and increased water depths resulted in the deposition of a basinal limestone and shale sequence in the area. Toward the east and south margins of the basin these sediments are replaced by shallow-water carbonate rocks which form a well-defined shelf and associated shelf margin. The productive reef belt is just basinward of the shelf and shelf-margin area. The reefs, which reach heights in excess of 490 m, range in areal extent from 5-124 km2. Porosities within the reefal carbonate rocks are as much as 43% and average 20-30%. Late Pliocene-Pleistocene normal faults which cut many of the reefs, combined with postreef structural tilt, modified considerably the original configuration of the reefs and the associated oil accumulations. The knowledge gained from the current exploration program concerning reef morphology, porosity variations, tectonic history, and other factors which control the oil accumulations should expedite future exploration efforts in the basin. The Foraminifera Globigerina, Globorotalia, Orbulina, Alveolinella, Marginopora, Sorites, Flosculinella, Rotalia, Elphidium, Cellanthus, Amphistegina, Operculina, Gypsina, Ammonis and Miliolids are mentioned, Coral, hydroxoan and algal (Amphilhoa, Lithophyllum, Aethesolithon, Corallina and Archeolithothamnium) debris are mentioned.","Indonesia","-1.35","130.95","","-10.8255440788","127.986263414","-9.83743","132.583"

Abstract ref. 604:
The Arun field is a giant gas-condensate field operated by Mobil and Pertamina with over 20,000 acres of closure at the top of the Arun reservoir.
A middle-shelf patch reef complex of early to middle Miocene age is the producing facies at the Arun field. About 1,100 ft of porous limestones, encased in shales, create a stratigraphic trap for overpressured hydrocarbons. Three main carbonate lithologies were encountered during the examination of over 4,300 ft of core: (1) a reef facies consisting of vuggy, coral encrusting, red-algal boundstones, (2) a near-reef facies consisting of foraminiferal, mixed-skeletal packstones with gravel-size coral fragments, and (3) an interreef lagoonal facies consisting of benthonic-foram packstones. Twenty-two species of corals have been identified from Arun reef facies; major reef-forming coals, listed in order of decreasing abundance, are Porites cf P. lutea, Cyphastrea microphthalma, Astreopora myriophthalma, Stylocoeniella guentheri, Porites solida, and Acropora ssp. The calcified tube around the siphon of the mollusk Kuphus is common in near-reef sediments. Two off-reef lithologies, interpreted as middle-shelf facies, were observed in cores: (1) benthonic-foram and planktonic-foram packstones on the gentle northwestern flank of the reef, and (2) dark-gray foram, mixed-skeletal packstones with intraclasts, on the steep eastern flank of the reef.
The Arun reef is comprised of limestones (with minor amounts of dolomite). No shale beds occur in the sequence, and all carbonate facies are in communication. A pervasive microporosity, occurring throughout the Arun Limestone, results from meteoric alteration of original carbonate mud to form a microrhombic porosity that accounts for about three-fourths of the field's total porosity. The remaining one-quarter is mainly vuggy porosity found in reef facies and, to a lesser extent, moldic porosity in lagoonal foram packstones where forams are preferentially dissolved.","Indonesia","5.05","97.25","86769","3.14063210475","96.0134186897","2.73382","100.357"

Miocene carbonates in the southern Mariana Islands are impressive for their lithologic diversity, thicknesses (over 250 m), and geographic extent (> 20% combined outcrop coverage over four major high islands: Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan). Sections are dominated either by lagoonal algal-foraminiferal wackestones and mudstones with locally abundant high-energy shelly-skeletal facies, or by rubbly to muddy, fore-reef-to-bank deposits of packstones and grainstones with highly diverse and variable biogenic clasts. Fresh to deeply weathered volcaniclastic material may comprise at least 80% of some high-energy fore-reef facies, whereas lagoonal and bank deposits usually contain less than 0.5% terrigenous material.

Surprisingly, the Miocene in the Marianas lacks almost completely any reef-core facies. Several poorly developed coral-rich mounds on Saipan and localized laminated red algal buildups on Guam appear to constitute the extant reef-wall facies in the Miocene. The lack of buildups may be a matter of differential survival; it may result from headland erosion and benching associated with emergence of narrow reef tracts as has been postulated by others for south Guam. Alternatively, we are proposing that Miocene bathymetry and the volume of terrigenous influx militated against significant reef core formation.

Radiometric age dating of these reef carbonates has proven unsuccessful because pervasive diagenesis has transformed the entire Miocene section into low-magnesium calcite with minor and occasional dolomite. Freshwater phreatic diagenesis accounts for the principal porosity variation and trace element distribution.","Pacific","15.2","145.7167","","14.6210762255","149.887952084","15.235","148.239"

Abstract of ref. 634:
An Early Tertiary regressive sedimentary succession developed along an active plate margin in Cyprus. A varied clastic and carbonate succession of the Miocene, Pakhna Formation and then Messinian evaporites culminates the regression. Within the Pakhna Formation, two phases of the reef growth were developed. The Terra Member reefs have limited acicular fringe cement (probably aragonitic). This is overlain by an abundant, marine, bladed, formerly high-Mg calcite cement. Later cements present in the reef facies include micritised calcite spars, perhaps indicating microboring in cements during their precipitation. The Koronia Member limestones show abundant indication of early lithification with fringing acicular aragonite and micrite cements. Stable isotopic data of the botryoidal aragonite cements indicate a marine origin.","Cyprus","34.9306","34.0931","69774","31.2010817404","33.0337868023","33.3353","32.4719"

Abstract of ref 640:
The terrigenous and carbonate sediments of the transgressive Oligocene cycle of the Tertiary Piedmont Basin outcropping in the area of Valzemola (Savona, western Liguria, Northwest Italy ) and which are referable to the Molare Formation are analysed. The terrigenous sequence, represented by breccias, conglomerates and sandstones, overlies with an angular unconformity dolomitic or calcareous-dolomitic lithologies referable to the San Pietro dei Monti Dolomite Formation. These sequences are locally characterized by rich associations of coralline algae and corals, which by providing a stable substrate allowed the development of a true reef build up. Subsequently the biotherm was suffocated by fluvial sandstone and conglomerate. This may be associated with an intensification in the amount of terrigenous material being brought into the basin. A progressive shallowing continues until the introduction of conditions suitable for calcareous deposition in an intertidal or supratidal environment. The analysis of this reef deposit was carried out by examining seven stratigraphic sections. The paleoecological study of the coral fauna and the algal assemblage, the latter characterized by the significant presence either of the genus Lithophyllum, or of Lithothamnion, allowed some hypothesis on the environmental conditions which characterized this sector during the Late Oligocene. Nine different facies could be shown, from those seven directly connected to the reef and two to nearshore environments proving a regressive phase. Facies I: conglomeratic-sandstone representing a stage of colonization in a dominantly terrigenous environment. Facies II: coral framestone, representing a stage of diversification ('an inner reef front' near to the 'reef crest'). Facies III: coral bafflestone representing a colonization stage in an 'inner reef slope'. Facies IV: coral bindstone representing a stage of domination in a 'reef crest' environment. Facies V: coral bindstone alternating with floatstone, gives evidence of a colonization stage in a carbonate environment. Facies VI: coral and algae floatstone, representing a facies of accumulated reef debris. Facies VII: coral rudstone, representing an accumulation facies comparable with that of the 'rubble & pavement zone' of the back reef. Facies VIII: conglomerates and sands of a shallow marine environment, represent a regressive sequence.
    Facies IX: massive limestones with undulated-zoned structures, rhizoliths, calcite veins and pisoliths, evidence of an intertidal or supratidal environment.","Italy","44.3667","8.2","36250","43.0616206741","7.91669113697","42.6706","7.05887"

Abstract of ref. 1553:
The present paper describes 10 genera and 18 species of stromatoporoids with such most important forms as Actinostroma clathratum Nicholson; A. cf. crassepilatum Lecompte, Clathrostroma bifarium (Nicholson), Synthetostroma acttnostromoides Lecompte, Stromatopora hupschii Bargatzky, S. cf. cimacensis (Lecompte), S. cf. maillieuxi (Lecompte), Parallelopora ostiolata Bargatzky, P. goldfussii Bargatzky and Stachyodes insignis Yavorsky. These species may be correlated with those of West and South China, and also with those occurring in the equivalent beds of many European countries and Canada, providing evidence for determining the Chitzechiao Formation is late Middle Devonian in age. The Jukoupu reefs occur in the Middle Devonian Chitzechiao Formation, a transition belt with a facies change from open shallow-sea marl to platform shallow-sea carbonate rocks. Based on the difference in sedimentary features, the reefs may be divided into two parts. The reefs in the lower part are clearly stratified and consist of thick-bedded framestones with stromatoporoids and massive corals. The thick-bedded limestones are intercalated with thin-bedded yellow mudstone, marl or mud shale with a thickness of 20-30 cm, indicating short-term and periodic changes in sedimentary environment. The reefs in the upper part are separated from the lower  reefs by a nearly 10 m thick layer of crinoidal limestone. The limestone with a total thickness of 120 m is poorly stratified, containing monotonous fossils mainly with crinoidal stems, dendritic or straticulate stromatoporoids and alveolites. Based on field observation and indoor identification, the Jukoupu reefs may be divided into 8 sedimentary microfacies, namely, micrites with massive stromatoporoids frames; mudstone-shale facies; micrites with massive compound coral frames; sparites with crinoidal fragments; biomicrosparites with biogenic incrustation; biobaffling micrites; oncolite micrites; and bioclastic micrites. The developmental process of the Jukoupu reefs may be as follows: nearshore normal shallow-sea environments.sbd.stromatoporoid reefs developed in the transitional belt.sbd.closed or semiclosed environments of back-reef facies abnormal salinity. The characteristics of the life assemblages and sedimentary facies generally vary with changes in sedimentary environments. Other species discussed are: Actinostroma voivojense, Gerronostroma tenuilaminae, Clathrostroma liujingense, Trupetostroma exquisitum, Stromatopora sinopachytexta, S. liujingensis, Salairella aspersa and Amphipora nonaxis.","China","27.1667","111.4167","80272","-14.6252959617","107.185985745","-3.43012","115.037"

Abstract ref. 1388:
Facies analysis and laboratory study has been completed on Upper Devonian to Lower Permian reefs and mounds of southern Kazakstan and Russia. Famennian reefs are composed of Girvanella-Renalcis-sponge-brachiopod boundstone and calcitic cementstone and form reef-rimmed platforms. Tournaisian and Lower Visean carbonates lack an organic margin and form ramps that contain Waulsortian mud mounds rich in crinoids, sponges, and rugose corals. Middle Visean through Serpukhovian carbonates consist of grainstone-rimmed platforms and slopes. Waulsortian mounds located in slope settings are composed of bryozoan-sponge-Tubiphytes-algae boundstone and calcitic cementstone. Bashkirian shelf margins consist of Donezellid-Archaeolithoporella-brachiopod boundstone and aragonitic cementstone. Lower Permian shelf margins and slope mounds are comprised of bryozoan-Tubiphytes-algae boundstone and calcitic cementstone and Palaeoaplysina rudstone. Devonian through Lower Carboniferous reefs and slope mounds are tight due to cementation; dolomitization and karsting enhance porosity in shelf margins and interiors. Middle Carboniferous and Lower Permian slope mounds and margin facies are porous due to exposure related diagenesis.   These data suggest that: 1) following a Late Devonian extinction event, major shifts took place in the composition and spatial distribution of reef and mound biota as carbonate benthos became re-established, and; 2) the distribution of reservoir-grade porosity is strongly influenced by early-marine cementation, dolomitization and meteoric-related diagenetic processes. Corresponding shifts in the morphology of carbonate platforms, and the spatial distribution of potential reservoirs, suggest a strong biotic and abiotic influence on platform architecture and reservoir development. Comparisons with study of Karachaganak and Tengiz fields confirm these observations.","Kazakhstan","51.1667","50.8333","","20.6584067785","-30.7629752733","6.01402","25.2681"

Abstract of ref 698:
The Early and Middle Jurassic High Atlas sea extended as a marine trough across what is now the central and eastern portions of the High Atlas Mountains, southern Morocco. The sedimentary infilling of this sea is recorded by a thick sequence of limestones and marls punctuated by spectacular coral-algal  reef horizons. A 1200 m-thick section of Aalenian and Bajocian sediments near Rich, Morocco, was studied in detail to document the upward-shoaling, basin-to-reef transition. The lower 900 m of the section represents deeper water deposition: it consists of monotonously interbedded, dark-hued marls and lime mudstones and wackestones that bear a pelagic fossil fauna, and scattered turbidities of lime grainstone. An overlying transitional sequence about 200 m thick records progressive shallowing, as shown by increased fossil diversity and abundance, an increase in algally micritized particles, a change from a pelagic to a benthic shelled fauna, an increase in limestone-to-marl ratio, and the appearance of small bioherms with scleractinian coral framework. The sequence is capped by a 100 m-thick horizon of very fossiliferous limestones and superbly preserved coral-algal reefs that grew in shallow water. Several lines of evidence suggest that some of the reefs grew on submarine ridges that were uplifted by Middle Jurassic  tectonic movements.","Morocco","32.2667","-4.5","204643","20.2452405854","4.29450927017","27.3521","-3.28087"

This reef complex is about 7 km wide and 70 km long, and is up to 100 m thick. A shoaling-up succession from bioclastic wackestone to coral-stromatoporoid boundstone is characteristic for this bioconstruction. The reef-frame is marked by massive-nodular, vase-shaped, and laminar coral morphotypes, encrusting and branching stromatoporoids, and green algae. Lateral facial differentiation in fore-reef slope facies and lagoonal deposits is well developed.

Abstract ref. 1786:
Macro- and microfossils and microfacies of a few Lower Cretaceous sections in the Mecsek
Mountains have been studied . Twenty five species of corals are reported for the time first from the
Hungarian Cretaceous . Fossils derived from the carbonate platform are often found together with
those of pelagic origin and monomictic volcanoclastics , indicating a special sedimentary environment .
Based on this study the following model is proposed for the Early Cretaceous geological history of the
Mecsek Mountains : instead of overall uplift and erosion giant basalt volcanoes grew above sea level
until the Valanginian , whilst bathyal conditions were preserved between them . The volcanoes were
bordered by gravel beaches , then sandy and silty lagoons , and the edge , of submarine slopes were
crowned by atoll-type build-ups . Fossils and rocks of dif ferent environments were transported down
the slopes of the volcanoes and mixed . As a result of widespread erosion during the Late Cretaceous
or Palaeogene only the basal parts of a few volcanoes are preserved .","Hungary","46.1667","18.25","25151","25.3437862138","25.0448502099","28.3569","24.8073"

Abstract of ref. 757:
The macrofaunal distribution of the mid-Cretaceous El Abra Limestone reef core is quantified from two measured sections in Taninul Quarry, San Luis Potosi, central Mexico. The faunal structure is transitional between typical Lower Cretaceous reefs dominated by corals with low density rudist bivalve packing. And densely-packed, rudist-dominated
Upper Cretaceous reefs. The macrofauna is predominantly associations of unconnected individuals of caprinid rudists,  with a low diversity of other shelly mollusks and corals. An examination of the alternation of paleocommunities defined  by the dominant caprinid taxa corals. An examination of the alternation of paleocommunities defined by the dominant  caprinid taxa reveals no pattern of biotic succession within the reef core. Large-scale sedimentologic features of mud  and debris content, coupled with rudist growth type, suggest that paleocommunities may have been physically controlled.","Mexico","22.0333","-98.9333","74181","22.4949993457","-64.6629553701","20.5031","-63.5668"

Abstract of ref. 743:
A coral-rudist limestone was newly discovered in the Lower Cretaceous (upper Aptian) sequence of the Miyako Group. It is small in scale but contains abundant frame-building organisms, notably autochthonous corals and rudists. Though vertical succession was not recognized, in some parts of the limestone, large and massive corals make a rigid framework, whereas in other parts the main frame-builder is Praecaprotina yaegashii (Yehara), a caprotinid rudist, which often forms clusters but does not show dense packing. This paper is the first concrete description of carbonate buildup in the Cretaceous of East Asia. Existence of coral-rudist buildup indicates that the northern limit of tropical-subtropical realm reached north Japan in late Aptian time. The influx of abundant clastic material may have prevented the buildup from the development of large-scale reefs, but small-scale buildups could grow, though temporarily or episodically, on the rocky shore in a transgressive stage.","Japan","39.9333","141.9444","26197","53.9515874861","160.140856203","53.1876","142.13"

Abstract of ref. 744:
The Middle and Upper Devonian limestone successions at Torquay and in the Lemon Valley SW of Newton Abbot (England) are described. Lithostratigraphic units are proposed for the Torquay succession. The compositions of the coral faunas in both successions are outlined and contribute, together with the other available faunal evidence, towards a broad internal dating of these limestone sequences. Successions elsewhere in the limestones of eastern South Devon are briefly outlined. On the basis of this evidence, facies variations from the margin towards the center of the carbonate platform in eastern South Devon are demonstrated and interpreted as reflecting the development of barrier reefs along parts at least of the platform margin in Givetian times. The character of the reef-complex, named the Tor Bay Reef-Complex, is briefly compared with Devonian reefs elsewhere.","United Kingdom","50.4667","-3.5","81012","-5.446280926","-77.4042780203","-27.839","1.89792"

Abstract ref. 1703:
The late Cretaceous saw the sessile rudist bivalves reach maxima of adaptive  diversity and abundance on Tethyan carbonate platforms, yielding extensive 'rudist formations'. Meanwhile, reef frameworks built by corals were of notably limited development, although diverse associations of corals in tabular bedded units may accompany the rudist formations. The hypothesis of competitive displacement of reef- building corals  by rudists has sometimes been invoked to explain these patterns. An alternative view is that they reflect passive faunal replacement mediated by environmentally triggered extinctions, perhaps together with changes in carbonate platform ecosystems. The hypothesis of competition between contemporaneous organisms cannot be tested by looking at patterns of biotic turnover alone, as such patterns are the effects of many factors. What is needed is detailed palaeoecological analysis of co-occurrences of the postulated competitors. The Santonian carbonate platform deposits of Sant Corneli in the southern Central Pyrenees contain abundant and diverse corals, as well as rudists. A spectrum of biotic assemblages, from coral-dominated to rudist-dominated, is found to correspond with a sedimentary facies gradient expressed both in vertical successions and in a lateral zonation. The corals  and rudists largely occupied different biotopes, and even in mixed assemblages no evidence for competitive interference between neighbours (e.g. overgrowth relationships) has been detected. These observations imply little, if any, mutual interference between members of the two groups, in the occupation of space, while inferred nutritional differences between them allow us to reject trophic overlap. Similar distributional patterns reported for other Cretaceous assemblages lead us to conclude that there was probably little or no competition between rudists and corals, so undermining the competitive displacement hypothesis. We further dispute the underlying assumption that the rudists were occupying broadly the same kinds of habitats that hosted coral reefs at other times: the rudists usually thrived on flat to gently inclined mobile sediment surfaces, which we argue would have been unfavourable sites for reef development.

About half the Caribbean hermatypic corals died out in the Caribbean during the latest Oligocene through Early Miocene, about 24-16 Ma. The majority of those corals that died out in the Caribbean are extant in the Indo-Pacific, i.e., they suffered geographic restriction, rather than extinction. The coral and coral associate faunas of three Upper Oligocene and three Middle Miocene fossil reefs in western Puerto Rico were compared. Coral genera at these sites suffered 50% regional extinction (extinction or restriction), equivalent to earlier reports of this Caribbean coral
extinction/restriction event. Nearly all coral genera tolerant of both turbidity and cool water survived. Those tolerant of cool water or turbidity alone survived in much lesser proportions. Corals occurring on both patch reefs and shelf edge reefs survived in much greater proportions than those occurring on only patch reefs or only shelf edge reefs. There are no shelf edge barrier reef complexes documented from the Early or Middle Miocene in the Caribbean. the uppermost Miocene shelf edge reefs of Mona Island are the only known Miocene shelf edge reef deposits in the Caribbean. Coral associates, the endolithic sponges, bivalves, worms, and barnacles that live in coral skeletons, were almost completely unaffected by this event. Likewise, reef and off-reef gastropods, bivalves, and echinoids suffered only insignificant
reductions in diversity. Only corals and large benthic foraminifera were strongly affected by the extinction. It is significant that zooxanthellate organisms were the primary victims of this extinction. Miocene endolithic sponge borings are significantly larger than their Oligocene counterparts, suggesting more intense bioerosion on Miocene than Oligocene reefs. Bioerosion is generally correlated with nutrient levels, and the apparently more intense bioerosion of
Miocene corals may indicate enhanced nutrient availability on Miocene Caribbean reefs. Extensive Miocene phosphorites throughout the Caribbean indicate enhanced upwelling in the region during the time of the coral extinction/restriction. Biogeographic evidence from corals, coral associates, and molluscs corroborates this pattern, along with the evidence from bioerosion levels. Enhanced upwelling could account for the extinction/restriction by generally increasing nutrient levels and cooling Caribbean costal surface waters, thus restricting reef development to on-shelf patch reefs, where corals would be subject to more intense sedimentation. Modern reefs of the Eastern Pacific may provide a modern analogue to Miocene Caribbean reefs. This regional extinction was important in
    dividing a previously cosmopolitan reef fauna into several modern provincial faunas. This biogeographic separation
    was completed in the mid-Pliocene with the rise of the isthmus of Panama. Coral associates, which universally
    survived the Oligocene-Miocene event, also have much more cosmopolitan distributions than do corals.","United States","17.9833","-66.9167","45403","19.3579479567","-66.8904222174","17.4296","-65.6758"

Abstract ref. 1588:
The size distribution and orientation of massive hemispherical tabulate corals and hemispherical stromatoporoids from the Fossil Hill and Manitoulin Formations on Manitoulin Island (Niagaran and Alexandrian, Ontario (Canada)), and of hemispherical stromatoporoids in the Flume and Upper Cairn Members of the Miette reef complex (Frasnian Alberta) and the Jamesville Member of the Manlius Formation (Helderbergian, New York (USA), was determined. In all 5 sample populations there is no statistically significant difference in the mean size between populations of heads in growth position and those disoriented. The process or processes responsible for disorienting heads evidently did not selectively disorient or remove specific size classes. Such disorientation, associated with little lateral transport of heads, could have been accomplished by infrequent short-lived strong wave and current action (storms), structural or soft substrate instability caused by increasing skeleton size due to growth or bioerosion, or some as yet unknown factor. Size-frequency distributions are potentially of value in separating in-place populations from those that have undergone disorientation or transport by size-selective processes. In a paleoenvironmental study this type of data, in conjunction with other information, such as sedimentological evidence or presence or absence of borers, could then be used to help determine the processes of disorientation and (or) transport.","Canada","53.0833","-117.6667","28074","-0.659096916541","-120.118684689","-9.11625","-46.2864"

Includes data for Mosquito Point reef and four Munnsville reefs.

On a global basis, carbonate buildups of Early Devonian age are little known compared to examples from Silurian and later Devonian time, and they may be rare in occurrence. Study of the Knoxboro buildup (a patch reef) and related buildups of the Deansboro Member of the Coeymans Formation (Lower Devonian) from central New York has provided insight into the style and development of buildups of this age. The Knoxboro buildup formed on an open marine carbonate platform, and it exhibits 3 distinct vertical stages of sedimentologic and biologic development. Stage I, initial colonization and substrate stabilization, is recognized by the growth of moderately large favositid tabulate corals on a crinoidal calcarenite substrate. Most tabulates are preserved in growth position. Stage II, growth to mean wave base, is characterized primarily by beds of micrite and biomicrite-biomicrudite with in situ colonies of dendroid
Favosites and Tryplasma corals. These beds form the core of the buildup. Channels, mostly filled with crinoidal debris, cut into beds formed during Stage II. Stage III diversification, is marked by beds of crinoidal debris which blanket the biomicrite core. Planar tabulate (favositid) corals and stromatoporoids (the latter often encrusting the former) are conspicuous in these uppermost beds. Localized occurrences of articulated crinoid columnals represent crinoid patches that occupied somewhat protected locations in the buildup area. Faunal diversity reaches a maximum in these beds,
although diversity appears to be no greater than that of equivalent non-buildup facies of the Deansboro Member. This tabulate and colonial rugose coral buildup is transitional in form and faunal composition between North American midcontinent Silurian buildups and later buildups of Middle Devonian age.","United States","42.9894","-75.5236","24955","-12.9496971507","-117.173811691","-35.5489","-33.314"

Abstract of ref. 1503:
Early Devonian limestones of Ellesmere, Bathurst, and smaller islands between them in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago contain a diverse fauna of stromatoporoid sponges. This fauna provides the best evidence in North    America of the early recovery phase of this reef-building group from a diversity low at the Silurian/Devonian boundary, a recovery that lead to its diversity peak in Givetian time. Stromatoporoids from the lower member of the Blue Fiord Formation locally form large reefal masses. Well preserved stromatoporoids also occur less abundantly: 1. in the top of the underlying Eids Formation, 2. in the upper member of the Blue Fiord Formation, 3. in the Disappointment Bay Formation, which is correlative of the upper Blue Fiord, and, 4. in the overlying Bird Fiord Formation, and a correlative unnamed formation, both of which span the Lower/Middle Devonian boundary. The stratigraphic distribution of these stromatoporoids can be accurately determined according to conodont biostratigraphy as spanning the dehiscence to partitus (Emsian to basal Eifelian) conodont zones. Common occurrences of Stromatoporella perannulata, Stictostroma gorriense, Habrostroma proxilaminatum, and Parallelopora campbelli in the arctic fauna and southern Ontario and the adjacent United States, indicate that the Detroit River Group is of similar Emsian age, and that the Eastern Americas realm was open to migration from the Arctic. Similarity of species with the Emsian faunas of Russia, Australia and China suggests the cosmopolitan and equatorial distribution of stromatoporoids in Emsian time and opens possibilities for using the group in correlation. The fauna is therefore important in establishing both the evolution of the order and also its geographic distribution in Early Devonian time. Twenty-five    species (assigned to 22 genera) are described. The species concept used is a broad one and the range of variation in each taxon is documented. New species described are: Gerronostroma septentrionalis, Anostylostroma anfractum,    Pseudoactinodictyon conglutinatum, Stictostroma? nunavutense, Clathrocoilona vexata, Stromatopora hensoni. The morphologic limits of the following genera are considered in the description of species: Plectostroma, Aculatostroma and Atelodictyon, Clathrocoilona, Salairella and Syringostromella. The range of Trupetostroma is extended downward into Emsian strata.","Canada","77.25","-86.8333","45306","13.5681044619","-108.847715123","-9.24296","-16.9766"

Abstract ref. 1594:
The MacKenzie, or northwestern, margin of the Frasnian (Late Devonian) Southesk-Cairn carbonate platform is exposed along the McConnell thrust (Laramide) approximately 45 km east of Jasper, Alberta. Exposure is approximately perpendicular to the platform margin providing an excellent example of bank-to-basin depositional style at the Cairn (Lower Leduc), Peechee (Upper Leduc), Grotto-Arcs (Nisku), and Ronde (Blue Ridge-Graminia) stratigraphic levels. The Southesk-Cairn carbonate complex initiated on a regionally extensive shallow-marine platform of the Flume Formation (latest Givetian to earliest Frasnian). The Flume platform overlies a relatively flat pre-Devonian surface and represents an overall deepening-upward sequence. Local evidence suggests that depositionally produced relief (i.e., stacked biostromes) within the Flume, played a fundamental role in the subsequent localization of the Southesk-Cairn platform margin in the Mount MacKenzie area during Cairn time. The Cairn margin has a transgressive, wedge-shaped profile. It is primarily composed of skeletal grainstones and represents a ramp-style bank-to-basin transition. The Cairn platform phase ended with a brief, but pronounced backstepping event. In contrast, the Peechee margin has a well developed stromatoporoid reef-margin facies, a broad back-reef sand apron and a relatively steeply dipping (about 10 degree ) foreslope facies. The combination of starved sedimentation in the adjacent basin and rapid aggradation of the Peechee reef-margin environment produced up to 200 m of platform-to-basin relief. The Grotto-Arcs strata represent a reef-rimmed margin that developed approximately 3 km bankward of the Peechee margin. The Arcs comprises reef and restricted platform-interior facies, whereas the Grotto represents a distally steepened ramp facies. Black, anoxic sediments of the Perdrix Formation were deposited adjacent to the northern margin of the Southesk-Cairn carbonate platform and represent a starved basin which developed during Cairn through Peechee and possibly Grotto time according to conodont data. The slow sedimentation rate of the Perdrix strata was replaced by an episode of very rapid basin infill by Mount Hawk sediments. Platform to basin relief was reduced and nearly filled next to the MacKenzie margin during the late Grotto and during a pre-Ronde sub-aerial exposure event. The Ronde margin initiated more than 4 km basinward of the underlying Arcs and then prograded an additional 2 km over lower Mount Hawk strata. It was a reef-rimmed margin with a moderately dipping foreslope facies characterized by a prominent slope buildup and an orange siltstone unit which separates it from the lower Mount Hawk Formation. A comparison with other outcropping platform-margins indicates that several factors in addition to regional sea level fluctuations influenced the development of these Late Devonian buildups.","Canada","53","-117.4167","","-1.58030725763","-118.665188911","-9.28713","-46.268"

Abstract of ref. 1627:
Various interpretations have been proposed for the origin of peculiar cone-shaped, finely crystalline, Devonian carbonate mounds of the Hamar Lakhdad Ridge, Anti-Atlas, Morocco, ranging from shallow-water reefs to deep-water mud mounds, formed by biogenic and/or hydrodynamic processes. This study is the first integrated sedimentological and geochemical analysis of these structures. The mounds are cone shaped, steep sided, circular to subelliptical in plan view, and exhibit internal crude bedding parallel to the mound's outer surface. They occur in a cluster of 48 mounds on top of a volcanic massif. Stable isotope analyses of first-stage isopachous nonluminescent cement have yielded marine values. In contrast, the finely crystalline carbonate that makes up the bulk of the mound and the internally sedimented mud between crusts of early marine cements have significantly lower delta18O values, whereas values of delta13C are similar to those of the early marine cement. Strontium isotope ratios also clearly distinguish the nonluminescent early marine cements from the finely crystalline material. The 87Sr/86Sr values for the former (0.707 934 - 0.709 392) are in or near the Devonian marine range, whereas the ratios for the latter (0.708 515 - 0.709 656) indicate a more radiogenic Sr source. On the basis of their lithology, architecture, isotope geochemistry, and clustered occurrence on top of a volcanic pile, we propose that the finely crystalline material that forms the mounds and the intermound beds was precipitated from hydrothermal fluids, and that accretion of the material was driven by hydrothermal venting.","Morocco","31.3833","-4.05","63041","-32.8312649535","-6.63621253106","-52.713","27.5853"

Abstract of ref. 979:
Carbonate rocks of the central Lahn (Germany) syncline were examined and sampled. In general, the development of biostromes begins in the Middle varcus zone of the conodont biostratigraphy after the interruption of the volcanic activity of the Givetian/Adorfian phase. Dendroid stromatoporoids and tabulate corals and sponges or platy stromatoporoids and rugose corals settle on top of the pyroclastic sediments resulting in a stabilisation of the substrate, depending on the bathymetric position. In favoured ecologic positions bioherms could develop, whereas deeper situated biostromes were buried by pyroclastics during the revived volcanism. Allochthonous carbonates are derived from reefs persisting into the Adorf-Stage of the Late Devonian.","Germany","50.4667","8.2167","77748","-1.3062777761","-67.3512159683","-21.0677","7.68144"

Abstract of ref. 2175:
The Devonian sedimentary succession of the southern flank of the Montagne Noire (France) was deposited along a divergent margin. This paper is a contribution to describe and evaluate biogenic, sedimentary, geochemical and micropalaeontological features as indicators of sea-level changes and global history of the Devonian in this area. Following transgression and shallow-water environments during Early Devonian time (Lochkovian to early Emsian), biogenic mud-rich mounds with stromatactis developed during latest Emsian at the platform margin. The depth of the Devonian sea was increasing and the seafloor passed below the photic zone and the lower limit of storm wave base during the Emsian. Growth and seismic faults affected the mounds and created Neptunian cracks and crevices, quickly filled with sedimentary material (pisoids) and cements (Neptunian dykes and veins). Light and CL-microscopy, and stable isotope geochemistry show that stromatactis, cements of Neptunian dykes, veins and pisoid cortices are early marine, whereas the red finely crystalline material that forms the bulk of the mound has been cemented in the near-surface diagenetic environment, after the early marine cementation of stromatactis and Neptunian dykes and veins, by meteoric or hydrothermal fluids. The sedimentary rocks overlying the stromatactis mounds exhibit regularly condensed iron and manganese-rich layers, interrupted by the Kellwasser hypoxic horizon. These condensed deposits developed up to the Famennian in a context of carbonate gravity sedimentation and became more and more rhythmic and frequent up section. The occurrence and irregular distribution of large-scale submarine mass flows during Frasnian and Famennian times can be related to block faulting on which Lower Devonian stromatactis mounds could have been uplifted by this block faulting to form seamounts. The sea-level fluctuations detected in the southern flank of Montagne Noire are compared to the Devonian eustatic sea-level curve of Johnson et al. (1985).

Abstract of ref. 1018:
Carbonate blocks of late Aptian (Lower Cretaceous) age occur in the Lower Yezo Group of central Hokkaido in northeast Japan. The shallow-water carbonates were emplaced by gravity sliding and rock fall into a deep-water flysch basin. Various lithofacies can be distinguished within the blocks including massive wackestone, bedded packstone and micro-oncoid grainstone, containing corals, rudists, an oyster, gastropods, calcareous algae and an orbitolinid foraminifer. 

Facies and palaeoecological analyses suggest deposition of low-energy biostromes and sand banks in open lagoonal and restricted environments with local higher-energy shoals and beaches. The presence of calcareous sandstones and abundant insoluble residues in limestones suggest deposition in an attached carbonate platform close to a supply of terrigenous material, rather than deposition upon seamounts within an oceanic setting. A narrow rimmed shelf in tropical--subtropical conditions would have been the depositional environment for these carbonates, which were subsequently deformed into blocks and transported into deep water as a result of the tectonic collapse of the platform.","Japan","43.2042","142.2167","49990","57.2211799771","160.536972869","51.0454","144.365"

Abstract of ref. 1027:
The development of peculiar margin facies and abundant talus breccias within the Dolomia Principale inner platform is commonly observed in the Lombardy Basin during the Norian. The organisms building these margins are mainly serpulids, benthic microbes, subordinate porostromata and other encrusting forms; typical margin organisms, as sponges or
corals, are extremely rare or absent. The build-ups form narrow rims along the borders of tectonic-controlled intraplatform basins. Regional back-stepping and progradation of the margin facies on the talus breccias produced by the erosion of the reef is commonly observed in the uppermost Dolomia Principale depositional system. Widespread occurrence of serpulids
and microbial margins in middle-late Norian times is indicative of stressed environmental conditions - fluctuation of salinity and temperature on the inner platform and in the intraplatform basins - controlled by palaeogeographic setting. Physical characteristics allowed the bloom of forms able to develop in a wide range of environmental conditions, such as serpulids.
In the Late Norian, major input of fine-grained clastics is recorded. Close to the Norian-Rhaetian boundary, carbonate ramps were regionally restored. Locally, small serpulid and microbial bioconstructions still persist in the lowermost part of the shaly succession, even if they are less abundant with respect to the Dolomia Principale. Patch-reefs generally do not build a platform margin, but represent isolated mounds within shaly deposits. These build-ups occur on the edge of former structural highs; the communities survived the environmental change responsible for the siliciclastic input and locally managed to produce mounds during the deposition of the lower part of the upper depositional system (Riva di Solto Shale).","Italy","45.9417","9.5722","67729","21.3290639828","22.870040792","29.2772","12.7293"

Abstract or ref. 1135:
Near Gascoyne Inlet, the topmost Douro and and lowermost Barlow Inlet Formations record overall upward  shallowing from ramp to shallow shelf conditions. This transitional sequence contains bioherms of various sizes, from small isolated reef mounds 1 to 2 m across to larger, compound reef mounds over 50 m thick and 60 m across, as well as distinctive inter- and pre-reef mound facies. The larger reef mounds show stages intermediate in character between those in sponge-dominated reef mounds of the Douro Formation and in larger stromatoporoid-crinoid-dominated reefs in the Barlow Inlet Formation. Three principal reef mound facies developed in turn. An initial partly lithified lime mudstone, containing scattered corals and apparently relicit sponge-cryptomicrobial fabrics, developed on sheets of oncolitic storm debris in mainly low energy conditions between storm and fairweather wave bases. This lower facies of the reef mounds achieved up to 2 m relief above surrounding burrowed, soft, detrital and carbonate muds. With gradual shallowing, and progressively higher energy conditions above fairweather wave base, middle facies of coral-and crinoid-rich mudstone developed, flanked by coalescing aprons of coarse crinodal debris. The middle facies achieved a maximum relief of 4 m. Detrital and carbonate muds succeeded the grainy flankbeds, as abrupt deepening    restored conditions of low energy below fair-weather wave base. The ensuing upper facies of the reef mounds is more  varied, comprising sparsely fossiliferous and locally fenestral lime mudstones, patchy coral bafflestone and bindstone, coarse encrinites, and substantial culminating stromatoporoid bindstone. Relief of the upper facies was progressively    reduced by onlap of adjacent muds. The reef mounds were ultimately engulfed by these muds, and a laterally discontinuous, biostromal, Stylopleura rudstone caps the sequence. With resumed shallowing, the sea floor again was exposed to more persistently turbulent conditions above fairweather wave base. Large  stromatoporoid-crinoid-dominated reefs formed just above the transitional sequence on topographic highs inherited from the reef mounds, and are flanked by substantial grainy crinoid-rich facies.","Canada","74.7","-91.4167","5790","5.20114668309","-72.3994016712","1.99207","-30.212"

Abstract ref. 1977:
A well-preserved coelobiontic biota of early Ovetian age (Early Cambrian; Moreno-Eiris et al. 1995. Paleozoic Cnidaria and Porifera from
Sierra Morena. Field Trip D. In PEREJON A. (ed.). VII International Symposium on Fossil Cnidaria and Porifera, Madrid, 1-68) is found near
the city of Córdoba (Ossa-Morena, southern Spain). Cryptic cavities occur at the unconformable boundary between an eroded, andesitic paleotopography, which belongs to the Neoproterozoic San Jerónimo Formation, and the giant reef complex of the Lower Cambrian Pedroche Formation (Zamarreño and Debrenne 1977.

Los montículos arrecifales de algas y arqueociatos del Cámbrico Inferior de Sierra Morena. Publicaciones Especiales del Boletín Geológico y Minero, 98, 1-127). The cavities exhibit several phases of growth, in some cases tectonically induced. The coelobiontic biota is preserved on the cavities (i) attached to the walls or encrusting previously attached organisms, and (ii) within the sediments that fill the cavities. The biota was diverse and consisted of encrusting, self-supported calcimicrobes, chancelloriids and archaeocyaths, found attached to walls and roofs of the cavities. Other reworked organisms preserved within the cavities are
trilobites, brachiopods and hyoliths derived from the overlying open-sea communities.","Spain","37.9167","-4.8167","78585","-68.6195106414","-6.48078188144","-55.9478","112.929"

Abstract ref. 1054:
Upper Cambrian carbonates in western Maryland are comprised of platform facies (Conococheague Limestone) west of South Mountain and basin facies (Frederick Limestone) east of South Mountain. Conocheague platform carbonates contain interbedded non-cyclic and cyclic facies. Non-cyclic facies consist of cross-stratified grainstones, thrombolitic bioherms, and graded, thin-bedded dolostones. These were deposited in shallow, subtidal shelf lagoons. Cyclic facies are composed of repeated sequences of cross-stratified grainstone: ribbon- rock, wavy, prism-cracked laminite and planar laminated dolostone. The cyclic facies are shallowing-upward cycles produced by lateral progradation of tidal flats over shallow, nearshore subtidal environments. Cyclic and non-cyclic facies are interbedded in the Conococheague in a layer cake fashion, but no higher-order cyclicity can be found. The Frederick Limestone is dominated by monotonously thick sequences of graded, thin-bedded limestones, interbedded with massive peloidal grainstones and beds of breccia up to 10 m thick in the lower Frederick. The breccias contain transported megaclasts of Epiphyton-Girvanella boundstones. The basal Frederick was deposited in a slope-to-basinal setting east of a rimmed shelf. An Epiphyton- Girvanella marginal reef along the shelf edge was the source of the blocks in the breccias. The upper Frederick Limestone formed on a carbonate ramp.","United States","39.6111","-77.9417","","8.43897728473","-102.69015855","-31.326","-79.1915"

Abstract of ref. 1060:
Carbonate buildups in the Flinders Ranges of mid-Early Cambrian age grew during a period of high archaeocyath diversity and are of two types: (1) low-energy, archaeocyath-sponge-spicule mud mounds, and (2) high-energy, archaeocyath-calcimicrobe (calcified microbial microfossil) bioherms. Mud mounds are composed of red carbonate mudstone and sparse to abundant archaeocyath floatstone, have a fenestral fabric, display distinct stromatactis, contain abundant sponge spicules and form structures up to 150 m wide and 80 m thick. Bioherms are either red or dark grey limestone and occur as isolated small structures 2-20 m in size surrounded by cross-bedded calcarenites and calcirudites or as complexes of mounds and carbonate sands several hundreds of metres across. Red bioherms comprise masses of white Epiphyton with scattered archaeocyaths and intervening areas of archaeocyath-rich lime mudstone. Grey bioherms are complex intergrowth of arachaeocyaths, encrusting dark grey Renalcis and thick rinds of fibrous calcite cement. The bioherms were prone to synsedimentary fracturing and exhibit large irregular cavities, up to 1.5 m across, lined with fibrous calcite. The buildups are isolated or in contiguous vertical succession. Mud mounds occur along in low-energy, frequently nodular, limestone facies. Individual bioherms and bioherm complexes occur in high-energy onshelf and shelf-margin facies. The two types also form large-scale, shallowing-upward sequences composed of basal (deep water) mud mounds grading upward into archaeocyath-calcimicrobe bioherm complexes and bioherms in cross-bedded carbonate sands. The uppermost sequence is capped by ooid grainstone and/or fenestral to stromolitic mudstone. The calcimicrobe and metazoan association form the two major biotic elements which were to dominate reefs throughout much of subsequent Phanerozoic time.","Australia","-31.3","138.9125","81170","1.30117543977","114.194401493","16.7791","-160.323"

Abstract of ref. 1063
The Shackleton Limestone formed a carbonate platform that bordered part of the Greater Antarctic craton in middle and late Early Cambrian time. In the Holyoake Range of the central Transantarctic Mountains, this unit records deposition on a stable shelf on which flourished ecological reefs composed of microorganisms and archaeocyathans. Burrow-mottled lime mudstone, wackestone and packstone with patch reefs represent accumulation in shelf areas of relatively low to moderate energy. Thick ooidal grainstone units reflect deposition in higher energy shoals and as sand sheets that were associated with extensive reef complexes. The framework of these reefs was principally the product of micro-organisims, by inference mostly cyanobacteria. Archaeocyathans constitute as much as 30% of some reefs, but commonly they forms less than 10% and are absent from some. On the basis of microbial composition, three reef types and are recognized. The first type is a Renalcis boundstone that lacks archaeocyathans. Within these, abundant upward-directed thalli of Renalcis formed a framework that trapped fine-grained sediment. The second type, which forms the core of some larger reefs, is composed of stroamtoctis-bearing, microbial boundstone. The third, yet most common, reef type is variable in composition. It is characterized by the presence of abundant Epiphyton, but may include archaeocyathans, and the microbial microfossils Girvanella and Renalcis as well as cryptomicrobial clotted micrite. In this type of reef, frame-building organisms typically constructed highly porous structures that had small interparticle and fenestral pores and large growth-framework cavities, as well as rare metre-sized caverns. Within these spaces, Epiphyton and, less commonly Ranalcis, encrusted framework elements, fine-grained sediments accumulated, and pervasive sea-floor cements were precipitated. Boundstone fabrics in the Shackleton Limestone are highly complex, with fabrics analogous to younger, more metazoan-rich reefs, as well as deep-water stromatactis-bearing mud-mounds. The Epiphyton-Girvanella-arachaeocyathan frameworks and stromatactis-bearing boundstone, both of which seemingly first appeared in the middle Early Cambrian, are regarded as the precursors, in structure, composition, and preferred hydrologic setting, of the more extensive reefs and complex framework styles of later Phanerozoic time.","Antarctica","-81.9167","158.75","80915","-12.1056092223","116.49058591","-0.579475","-155.062"

Abstract ref. 1615:
Microcavities within allochthonous Cambrian Epiphyton algal mounds in the upper Shady Dolomite (Shady Formation) of southwestern Virginia contain a preserved coelobiontic (cavity-dwelling) biota of probable late Early Cambrian age. The microcavities (range from 0.3 mm to 15.0 mm across (mean, 2.0 mm) and are constructed by overgrowth of Epiphyton fronds. Epiphyton dominates the coelobiontic biota, although other algae occur on the cavity roof and walls, including spherical micro-algae (?), crust-forming Girvanella and Cavifera, a probable endolithic alga found only in the fringe cements within microcavities. Globular Foraminifera (?) or foraminifer-like microorganisms, possible brachiopods and cylindrical borings also occur on or in the roofs and walls. Disarticulated, small inarticulate brachiopod valves, sponge spicules and grains bored by endolithic microphytes are in the sediment flooring many microcavities. This indicates that microboring algae or fungi, sponges and inarticulate brachiopods, probably inhabited the microcavities. Traces produced on the surface of the sediment in some microcavities and small spines show that vagrant organisms were moving within or through cavities. Localized areas of Epiphyton have been planed flat, pointing to the presence of an unidentified grazing organism in the microcavities. These mounds occur stratigraphically above archaeocyathid patch reefs in the Shady (Dolomite) Formation. The mounds contain no archaeocyathids. The presence of coelobiontic organisms in Lower Cambrian algal mounds lacking a skeletal framework suggests that coelobiontic organisms were not restricted to skeletal reefs but that at least by the end of the Lower Cambrian they had exploited the cavity habitat in algal mounds.","United States","36.8525","-80.9022","24039","8.24701011392","-121.689639549","-27.2316","-95.0528"

Abstract ref. 1554:
The Cathedral lithosome was generated by the expansions and contractions of a middle carbonate facies belt, deposited at low latitudes on a young, north-facing, thermally subsiding continental margin. It is bounded above by a quasi-synchronous contact, and below by a strongly diachronous contact that youngs eastward to intercept the upper contact. The outboard limit was controlled by, and partly corresponds to, a platform-bounding, organosedimentary reef established above a subtle, linear uplift at the beginning of the Middle Cambrian. Growth of the lithosome took place in three pulses, each succeeding an episode of abrupt sea level rise. Each of these rises introduced new fauna onto the platform and is interpreted as eustatic. At the beginning of each abrupt rise, the carbonate complex was reduced to a narrow rim. As eustatic rise slowed, the carbonate rim complex began to expand into the sheltered inshore basin above the mud-grade inner detrital sediments (Mount Whyte Formation) of the drowning phase. The facies are peritidial over and near the rim and lime-mud-dominated subtidal inboard. Outward expansion of the complex was limited during the early history of the lithosome, and effectively nil during the late stages. Growth of the Cathedral lithosome was terminated by a pulse by a pulse of sea level rise more pronounced than those preceding. This drowned the carbonate complex and admitted open-sea energy to the inshore basin. Craton-derived inner detrital muds (Stephen Formation) were then spread from the inshore basin, across the former site of the carbonate rim and, for the first time since the beginning of Cathedral deposition, into the offshore basin. A series of lithofacies maps on a palinspastic base illustrates paradoxical aspects of lithostratigraphic nomenclature: in the case of a deeply tongued lithosome like the Cathedral, the name given to a depositional unit commonly depends on the lithofacies of overlying and underlying units.","Canada","51.4167","-116.5","45280","38.2466354872","-114.92555271","1.07281","-78.3906"

Abstract ref. 1070:
 I - Framework reefs occurring at the base of the carbonate interval of the Puerto Blanco Formation. These consist of an archaeocyathan framework with encrusting renal acids and abundant fibrous cements. Cavities are filled with mudstone and contain rare sponge spicules. Cements are well developed upon internal sediments. The archaeocyathan fauna is dominated by colonial Paranacyathus along with Batenevia and Claruscoscinus with taeniae and curved tabulae. A few regular archaeocyaths are present, including Palmericyathus and Aulocricus. Lateral to the reef facies the lime mud sediment contains abundant skeletal fragments of trilobites, echinoderms, Chancelloria, hyoliths, and archaeocyaths. These buildups are interpreted to have formed as wave-resistant, framework reefs in a tidally dominated, shelf-margin setting seaward of a carbonate barrier. II - Girvanella-dominated buildups located in the upper part of the carbonate interval of the Puerto Blanco Formation and associated with oolites. These are built by stacked Girvanella crusts, with an important contribution of Renalcis and a less important presence of Epiphyton. Shelter cavities are filled by mudstone often rich in siltsize quartz. Cements are poorly developed and confined to the intraskeletal cavities. Archaeocyaths are scattered in the Girvanella frame either as isolated individuals or as clusters of solitary or colonial forms. Regular archaeocyaths are here abundant, represented by several taxa with an ethmophylloid inner wall, including Palmericyatbus and Cordilleracyathus. The dominant genus is Aulocricus. Colonial species of Archaeocyathus and Arrythmocricus are well developed. These latter two genera are now recorded from Mexico to northern Canada. The internal and lateral sediment contains a rich fauna represented by trilobites, Chancelloria, echinoderm plates, hyoliths, brachiopods, and helcionellacean mollusks. We interpret these buildups to have formed in a back-shoal setting as isolated patch reefs and laterally continuous biostromes. Samples of float from the Buelna Formation contain cryptalgal boundstones consisting of isolated and rare archeocyathan cups in a homogenous micritic tissue interpreted to have resulted from cyanobacterial activity. There are abundant cavities filled with internal sediments that contains scarce skeletal remains. cements are poorly developed. Marine cements are lacking, possibly because they have been replaced by blocky calcite of meteortic origin. Rather large specimens of Claruscoscinus and Archaeocyathus are present. The bioconstructions probably formed subtidally above storm wavebase. Twenty-two taxa of Archaeocyatha are recognized. Two new genera and eleven new species are described. The fauna from the Puerto Blanco Formation is Botomian in age. The fauna from the Buelna is probably Toyonian.","Mexico","30.2667","-112.0833","62866","30.6041852019","-141.236463741","-1.48997","-102.351"

Abstract of ref. 1971:
Patch reefs up to 35 m thick and generally 100-150 m wide, separated by bedded inter-reef sediment, dominate the Högklint Formation (Lower Wenlock) of north-west Gotland. The spacing between adjacent patch reefs is variable, but is commonly 150-350 m. The Högklint is a shallowing sequence, and the patch reefs exhibit a well-developed vertical succession: (1) Axelsro-type patch reefs developed in the underlying Visby Formation; (2) halysitid tabulates capped by laminar stromatoporoids; (3) domical and bulbous stromatoporoids and red algae; (4) cyanobacterial-algal reef crest. The patch reefs expand upwards from an initial bioherm phase with a small base to a laterally extensive biostrome phase. This gives them a thumb-tack appearance. In stage 2 of the bioherm phase, rigid framework development and high reef relief resulted in breakage of angular blocks up to 15 m long, which were incorporated into the reefs or fell into adjacent sediments. Poorly sorted talus haloes (Millingsklint Member) also developed adjacent to stage 2 of the bioherm phase. These include angular blocks and exhibit depositional slopes up to 40° away from the reefs. Stage 3 biostrome development was mainly non-rigid cluster reef, which shed skeletal debris (Domkyrka Member) but few lithified blocks. Stage 4 biostrome development was a reef crest with open to closed frame structure. Storm breakage and overturning produced large blocks with complex cavity fill sequences including double geopetals. Relief during the bioherm phase, indicated by fallen blocks and talus slopes, was up to at least 15 m; during the biostrome phase, it was up to 10 m.","Sweden","57.85","18.4833","13592","-8.37920938826","-49.6680565447","-18.3504","-4.40391"

Abstract of ref. 1830:
With the possible exception of some older aggregations of  tubicolous skeletal forms, bioherms in. the Pestrotsvet Formation (Tommotian) of the southeastern Siberian Platform represent Earth's earliest metazoan-mediated reefs. They are certainly the earliest known bioconstructions of metazoan-calcimicrobial type. The bioherms are geographically limited to the transitional facies tract of the Siberian Platform, 
  separating restricted lagoonal from deep ramp and slope sediments.
Bioherms are intergrowths of archaeocyaths, calcimicrobes (Renalcis) and rare coralomorphs (Cysticyathus) in lime
mudstone which was cemented early on the sea poor. They consist of meter-scale mounds occurring either singly or stacked together.
Mounds can be categorized into component domains occupied by associations of lime mud, archaeocyaths, calcimicrobes and 
  cement. Some mounds are simply a conglomeration of such domains, with no discernible pattern of internal distribution, while 
  others possibly show incipient ecological succession. The calcimicrobe Renalcis was the major bioconstructor; it and the 
  synsedimentary cement were the principal contributors to framework construction. Archaeocyaths of themselves rarely 
  produced a framework, except where stereoplasm was abundant. 
  Nevertheless, the archaeocyaths provided substrates for the Renalcis and cement, and facilitated the development of
internal cavities.
  Archaeocyaths appeared, as bioconstructors, in the basal Tommotian sunnaginicus Zone. In the succeeding regularis Zone and thereafter, they flourished throughout the mounds, in some cases forming thickets of large sticklike cups atop mature mounds.
The bioconstructional regime established in these Tommotian bioherms prevailed throughout the Early Cambrian reef-building phase, particularly in argillaceous limestone facies. Likewise, the trophic web of this very early Cambrian community remained a  blueprint for shallow wafer, open, marine habitats throughout the epoch.","Russia","60.7833","125.0167","80802","3.36241382537","-74.1015385446","-13.024","-14.0017"

The Lower Cambrian outcrops near Terrades (Gerona province, Spanish Pyrenees) are mainly siliciclastic interlayered with some bioclastic limestones or reef mounds. Previous works (Abad, 1987, 1989) allowed us to recognize three stratigraphic sections representative of the bioconstructed levels, as well as their spatial relationship and correlation. Microbial mounds are mainly formed by calcimicrobes (Epiphyton and Renalcis). Archaeocyathans are the secondary elements in these boundstones and the following genera have been identified: Taylorcyathus, Gloriosocyathus, Rasetticyathus, Erismacoscinus, Mennericyathus, Coscinocyathus and Anthomorpha. These mounds are superimposed and can reach up to 20 m in thickness. Small mounds are present over the big calcimicrobial mounds. These are buildups by branched colonial archaeocyathans with a high cups density mainly of Anthomorpha and Erismacoscinus.
The skeletal metazoans are surrounded by calcimicrobial elements. Lenticular carbonatic beds are located one
km away from the mounds. These beds are bioclastic, nodular and brechoid limestones, interstratified with siliciclastic sediments. The main components in the carbonatic levels are calcimicrobes and archaeocyathans, lacking of building mounds. Sedimentological characteristics suggest a restricted shallow area. Thirty genera of Archaeocyathans have been identified among which nine are new. The Terrades assemblage is typical for the Archaeocyatha Zone VII of the Upper Ovetian (Perejon, 1986 and in press). Some genera are common with Sardinia (i.e. Taylorcyathus, Rasetticyathus, Antoniocoscinus, Porocoscinus) and Morocco (i.e. Inacyathella).

Abstract ref. 1650:
Lower to Upper Silurian (upper Llandovery-Ludlow) limestones belonging to the Heceta Formation record several episodes of reef growth in the Alexander terrane of southeastern Alaska. As the oldest carbonates of widespread distribution in the region, the Heceta limestones represent the earliest development of a shallow-marine platform within the Alexander arc and the oldest foundation for reef evolution. The excellent preservation of biostromes, fringing and barrier reefs, and a mud mound in shelf, shelf margin, and slope deposits, respectively, contrasts with the restricted occurrence of many marine sediments that originated within other island arcs. Hence, these deposits provide important insights into the dynamic processes, styles, and bathymetry associated with reef growth in tectonically active oceanic islands. Massive stromatoporoids, corals, and red algae are preserved in fragmental rudstones and represent a fringing reef that formed at the seaward edge of the incipient marine shelf. Accessory constitutents in this  reef include crinoids and the cyanobacterium Girvanella. Small biostromes were contructed by ramose corals and stromatoporoids on oncolitic substrates in backreef or lagoonal environments. These buildups were associated with low-diversity assemblages of brachiopods and with gastropods, amphiporids, calcareous algae and cyanobacteria. Microbial boundstones reflect the widespread encrustation of cyanobacteria and calcified microproblematica on shelly debris as stromatolitic mats that resulted in the development of a stromatactoid-bearing mud mound and a barrier reef complex. Epiphytaceans, other microbes, and aphrosalpingid sponges were the primary framebuilders of the barrier reefs. These buildups attained significant relief at the shelf margin and shed detritus as slumped blocks and debris flows into deep-water sites along the slope. The similarity of these stromatolitic-aphrosalpingid reefs to those from Siluro-Devonian strata of autochthonous southwestern Alaska suggests paleobiogeographic ties of the Alexander terrane to cratonal North America during the Silurian.","United States","55.7472","-133.4472","79357","6.85653876746","-118.070892432","-2.81909","-91.9059"

Abstract ref. 1103:
'Ladatheca' cylindrica (Grabau, 1990) was a eurytopic metazoan with a calcareous operculum and an elongate, gently tapering conch up to 15+ cm long and with an apical angle of approximately 0.75-2.0.degree.. This apparent polychaete was geographically widespread in the sub-trilobitic Lower Cambrian of middle latitude, siliciclastic (middle and upper Placentian Series, Avalon Zone) and low latitude, carbonate platform (Tommotian Stage, Siberia(?) and Kazakhstan; and, probably, the upper Meishucunian Stage, southwestern China) sequences. In situ conchs (vertically to steeply inclined, apex down) of 'Ladatheca' cylindrica are common in deep subtidal, siliciclastic mudstones (Chapel Island Formation) and in a peritidal algal mud mound(?) limestone (West Centre Cove Formation) in southeastern Newfoundland. Closely juxtaposed conchs locally form a worm reef at the top of the West Centre Cove Formation. This structure is older than the oldest archaeocyathan build-ups and is the earliest known metazoan-constructed biostrome. 'Ladatheca' cylindrica was a dominant element of the sessile benthos prior to its apparent ecological displacement by Coleoloides typicalis Walcott, 1889, in the upper Placentian Series.","Canada","48.6028","-53.4056","80844","-78.8047794033","-98.4491709907","-86.0436","21.4572"

Abstract of ref. 1105:
The Racine Formation of southeastern Wisconsin contains a diverse reef fauna of Silurian (Wenlockian) age. A collection of more than 10,000 specimens from this fauna includes 191 species and 38 guilds of reef constructors, binders, bafflers and dwellers. Constructors and binders include stromatoporoids, tabulates, rugosans and bryozoans; bafflers include branching tabulates and dendroid rugosans. Only locally do these groups form a skeletal framework, and for the most part, their remains are separated by reef matrix. Reef dwellers are represented by diverse guilds of brachiopods, gastropods, cephalopods, trilobites and echinoderms, and they also include receptaculitids, sponges, solitary rugosans, bryozoans and bivalves. Tiering within the fauna is well developed and probably extended to a height of 1 m above reef surfaces. This reef fauna exhibits higher species diversity, greater numbers of guilds and more extensive tiering than Silurian level-bottom communities. Relatively few of its taxa, however, are restricted to Silurian reef environments. Constructors, binders and bafflers in the reef fauna have morphologic and taxonomic parallels in level-bottom communities, as do nearly all taxa of reef dwellers. Higher diversity in the reef fauna is not a function of specialized reef guilds and species, but results from packing of more species into the same guilds which are present in level-bottom communities. In this regard, the Silurian reef fauna differs fundamentally from that of today and reflects the generally low grade of ecologic complexity of the Paleozoic evolutionary fauna.","United States","42.7167","-87.8833","13069","-27.3049366007","-89.5142317003","-21.8784","-51.8158"

Abstract ref. 1116:
Investigation of extensive skeletal grainstone deposits that comprise much of the Middle Ordovician sequence in East Tennessee revealed 2 distinct carbonate buildup complexes. The Rockdell Formation comprises abundant pelmatozoan-bryozoan grainstones and packstones and lesser deposits of lime wackestone. These deposits represent carbonate sand shoals, consisting of a mixture of in situ and transported skeletal grains, which surround relatively small, isolated to anastomosing, lime-mud mounds. The Rockdell buildup was developed in shallow-water, high-energy conditions on a relatively stable platform. The Holston Formation is dominated by bryozoan-pelmatozoan packstones that surround roughly elliptical masses of bryozoan wackestone/boundstone. The Holston represents a series of lime-mud bryozoan patch-reefs that were surrounded by piles of in situ skeletal sand produced in pelmatozoan-bryozoan thickets. The Holston buildup developed in deeper water on the outer platform or perhaps downslope. Recognition and distinction of these 2 buildups is based on consideration of a number of criteria including:
color, overall composition and distribution of flora and fauna; composition and distribution of bryozoan fauna; types and distribution of component lithofacies; and character of associated lime-mud deposits. Distinction of these buildups has major importance in the determination of East Tennessee paleogeography during the Middle Ordovician and also has implications for possible hydrocarbon exploration in these deposits. The criteria applied here may be useful in making distinctions among other carbonate buildups in the geologic record.","United States","36.3333","-82.8333","80594","-19.0166653792","-114.192300827","-29.263","-63.5283"

Abstract of ref. 2160:
A completely dolomitized Silurian reef at Maumee, Ohio, U.S.A., is uncommon among early Paleozoic reefs in that its framework consists of about 95% thrombolite boundstone and 5% corals. The reef lithified syndepositonally, as evidenced by centimeter- to meter-scale growth framework cavities within it that are completely filled with internal sediment. The largest cavities, 2--3.5 m in diameter, are probably the
largest ever recorded in a thrombolite reef.

Four main types of components are distinguished in the reef framework: (1) dense bushy mesoclots, (2) dense rounded to subrounded mesoclots, (3) saccate
microstructures, and (4) crusts, mostly structureless, but also containing dense bushy mesoclots. The dense bushy components are abundant; rounded to sub-rounded
mesoclots less so, and the remaining components are rare. The dense bushy and rounded to subrounded mesoclots are interpreted to represent the calcified remains of what were initially either aggregates of the probable filamentous cyanobacterum Angulocellularia or aggregates of renalcid calcimicrobes, or both, and the saccate mesoclots as the calcimicrobe Renalcis sensu stricto. It is speculated that syndepositonal lithification of the reef framework was accomplished by impregnation of unlithified protomesoclots by micrite to create mesoclots along with the formation of micritic cement around and between mesoclots that served to fuse together successive generations of mesoclots.

The direction of branching of bushy mesoclots in the reef indicates that unlithified protomesoclots were able to grow upward, laterally, and downward. This ability, along with syndepositional lithification to create mesoclots and to cement them together, enabled the protomesoclots and mesoclots to create reef knobs and, eventually, to roof over spaces that were centimeters to three or more meters in width and height to create growth framework cavities. Features indicative of rapid deposition including graded bedding, poor sorting of bioclasts, and textural inversion are common in internal sediment in meter-size cavities. These features suggest that storms, possibly hurricanes, were at least as important, and probably more so, than 'everyday' wave energy in transporting sediment into all cavities in the reef, regardless of size.","United States","41.5833","-83.65","","-27.2276968035","-74.3251162098","-27.0792","-46.8607"

Bryozoan-coral bioherms.
Mostly branching bryozoa, encrusting bryozoa, rugose and tabulate corals.

Abstract or ref. 1136:
Several small, previously undescribed bioherms are present in the shallow shelf dolostones of the Manitoulin  Formation (Llandoverian) at the Cabot Head and Wingfield Basin localities in the northernmost portion of the Bruce Peninsula region of southern Ontario (Canada). The bioherms, commonly associated with carbonate tempestites, range from 0.3 to 1.0 m in height and 0.9 to 2.5 m in width and are composed of bafflestones-floatstones and minor bindstones. The chief components of the bioherms are dolomitized lime mud and branching bryozoans. Bioherm building by bryozoans, although common in the ancient record, represents a great divergence from the mostly accessory frame encrusting role of bryozoans in modern environments. Minor skeletal components of the bioherms include
echinoderms, rugose and tabulate corals and brachiopods. Laminar encrusting bryozoans exist in the top 10 cm of one of the bioherms. Some of the bioherms show evidence of water agitation that may be the result of current action induced by storm or tidal processes. This evidence includes offlapping debris and abrupt near-vertical margins aligned approximately perpendicular to depositional slope of the basin. The occurrence of the Manitoulin Formation bryozoan bioherms on the Bruce Peninsula stretches the already known Llandoverian reef complex on Manitoulin Island further to the south. The reason why these bioherms did not reach sizes comparable to large Llandoverian or Wenlockian reefs and did not make the shift to a coral-stromatoporoid community is probably related to a complex interaction of internal and external factors such as community development, bathymetry, clasticity, and salinity.","Canada","45.2361","-81.2847","","-25.8718828245","-98.2554791019","-21.0571","-48.7175"

Abstract of ref. 2125:
The Duhamel reef is an isolated Upper Devonian Leduc Formation limestone bioherm, situated immediately NNE of the Bashaw reef complex in south-central Alberta. Although Duhamel has a relatively small basal area (less than 12 km2), this reef rises some 275 m above the platform facies. From seismic data it is interpreted that there is a raised peripheral reef rim that appears to be elevated about 25 m relative to the interior of the reef. Although late-stage accretionary growth about the periphery of the reef complex may have contributed to its development, the raised rim at Duhamel is interpreted to be principally of secondary origin. Optimal hydrocarbon recovery could be realized if all production wells were drilled into the raised reef rim. The Duhamel example shows that even relatively small Leduc reefs can exhibit raised rims and that these rims may be seismically visible.","Canada","52.8833","-113.0167","","-3.34459487907","-116.680985996","-13.4997","-42.0841"

Abstract ref. 1708:
The Westerose field produces hydrocarbon from a dolomitized Upper Devonian reef. The reef is 1.6 km by 5.5 km and up to 214 m thick and is not well differentiated into organic reef margin and reef interior facies. Laterally continuous tidal flat and restricted lagoon sediments, which create vertical permeability barriers with the interiors of other reefs, were not observed. Secondary pore systems dominate porosity. The large vugs and fossil molds are well connected throughout the  reef by a pervasive vertical to subvertical fracture system. The equicrystalline xenotopic dolomite matrix has low porosity (3.2%) and permeability and does not contribute to effective intervug communication. The effect of diagenesis on the depositional fabric has made it difficult to subdivide the reef using depositional facies-reservoir quality relationships. Nonparametric statistical techniques were applied to core data to identify trends in permeability and porosity within the reef. Reef  cores were assigned to flank, margin or interior positions based on reef  morphology, an arbitrarity divided into vertical layers 25 m thick giving a total of 17 layer-position combinations. Horizontal permeability, vertical permeability and porosity increase from reef flank to reef interior and from the upper reef to the base of the cored reef. Cumulative probability plots of horizontal permeability data, grouped by reef  position, each exhibit the characteristics of the log-normal distribution but with a portion of the highest permeability values truncated from the data set. Truncation is due to poor core recovery from the highest permeability regions as well as to the limitations of the permeability measuring procedure on high permeability core. Vertical permeability data are not truncated. Truncation effects must be taken into account when estimating average horizontal permeability. Although significant trends in the magnitude of permeability are present within the reef, the reservoir fluid flow model for the rock volume being drained by a single well is best described as a random arrangement of blocks of differing permeability. Permeability calculated for the oil zone from a pressure build-up test is 1115 mD. When corrected for truncation, the geometric average of the core data from within the producing zone of the pressure test is 760 mD, consistent with the pressure test result; the arithmetic mean of the corrected data set would be much too large. The similarity between the geometric average of the horizontal permeability calculated from the pressure build-up test at Westerose is expected from the disordered arrangement of units of differing permeability.","Canada","52.8333","-114.0667","","-2.99571304106","-117.213498934","-13.0581","-42.5543"

Abstract of ref. 1529.
Rich and various crinoidal assemblages existed at Callovian-Oxfordian time in the Sudak environs on Crimea. 22 species are described: Dolichocrinus aberrans, Eugeniacrinitescaryophilites, E. quenstedti, Pilocrinus moussoni, Cyrtocrinus nutans (order Cyrtocrinida), Millericrinus annulatus, M. convexus, M. echinatus, M. etalloni, M. goupilianus, M. granulosus, M. knorri, M. milleri, M. multipunctatus, M. rotiformis, M. thiollieri (order Millericrinida), Balanocrinus dumortieri, B. subteres, Margocrinus modestus, Chariocrinus? burgundicus, Isocrinus amblyscalaris and 'Pentacrinus' cingulatissimus (order Pentacrinida). The described species belong to two ecological  types: cirriferous (long-stalked plastic, long-stalked immovable and short-stalked forms) and cirriless (long-stalked and short-stalked). Crinoids occupied four trophic tiers and inhabited four types of the biotopes: interreef depressions, interreef rises, reef slopes and reefs. A certain connection exists between biotope types, trophic tiers of crinoids and their ecological types. Tubular worms, bryozoans, bivalves, sponges and corals were settling on crinoid stalks in a certain sequence during the lifetime of crinoids or after their perishing. Millericrinid stems were damaged by parasites, predators and scavengers. Pentacrinid stems were twisted, depending on the environmental dynamics. Atrophy of cirri is typical for tong-stalked flexible pentacrinids.","Ukraine","44.8167","34.9167","67868","36.2803380782","49.0947960971","38.2128","40.9438"

Dialeptophyllum vopnii gen. et sp. nov., a solitary kyphophyllid coral, is described from the reef flank macrofacies. Thryptophyllum undafundus gen. et sp. nov. is described from the reef flat and reef flank macrofacies, and is referred to a new subfamily of the named Thrptophyllinae. Agastophyllum eximium and Thryptophyllum undafundus are Giventian, Middle varcus zone age; Dialeptophyllum vopnii is presumed to belong to the same zone, and is certainly Givetian. Four undescribed species of Agastophyllum are reported from late Eifelian strata of Western Canada. Dialeptophyllum vopnii and an unnamed Emsian species from the Nelichen Formation of the Indigirka River drainage area of the northeastern Soviet Union are the only known species of Dialeptophyllum. An early Givetian species from the Rockport Quarry Limestone of Michigan, originally described by Ehlers and Stumm (1949), under the name Spongophyllum romingeri, is transferred to the new genus Thryptophyllum.","Canada","62.1667","-117.8333","34871","2.30354065345","-117.196160051","-8.21647","-36.5264"

Carbonate rocks are widespread on the Andaman-Nicobar Islands, northern Indian ocean, ranging in age from Early  Miocene to Pleistocene. Lithologically they range from deep water to shallow water calcarenites. Thin section analysis of the limestones showed the following major lithofacies: lithic foraminiferal-algal grainstone-packstone; lithic foraminiferal-algal wackstone-mudstone; volcanoclastic packstone-wackstone/radiolarian cherts; foraminiferal packstone; coralgal boundstone and coarse lithic foraminiferal-algal-molluscan packstone-grainstone. They exhibit sequential changes in their fabrics, biogenic and clastic constituents. Depths of deposition ranged from high energy, shallow neritic (lithic foraminiferal-algal grainstone-packstone facies) at the beginning of Early Miocene to progressively lower bathyal marked successfully by lithic foraminiferal-algal wackstone-mudstone, volcanoclastic packstone-wackstone and radiolarian chert facies. The sudden influx of glass shards and tephras in the later Early Miocene suggests that progressive deepening of the basin occurred contemporaneously with explosive volcanism in    neighboring areas. During this interval of basinal subsidence, the limestones received abundant argillaceous material from subaerial erosion of nearby volcanic terrain. Gradual reduction in the frequency of glass shards and pumice from Middle Miocene (Ongeian Stage) onwards indicates culmination of volcanic eruptions and basinal stability. Gradual shallowing to subtidal and patch reef (coralgal facies) environments began to form from the Middle Miocene onwards at Little Andaman, Havelock, Nicholson and other islands. Deep basinal conditions prevailed during the Late Miocene to Early Pliocene at Neill, Sir Hugh Rose and Car Nicobar Islands. These different conditions may be attributed to    tectonism in the Andaman sea region which occurred during the close of Middle Miocene. Thereafter, younger   limestone facies of Plio-Pleistocene age, reflect a shoaling upwards to probable intertidal conditions due to rapid infilling and vertical uplift of the basin floor. No hydrocarbons were observed in the limestone sequences. The regional stratigraphic and petrographic studies reveal the presence of potential reservoir rocks in the Ongeian-Havelockian limestones of Middle Miocene age on the Andaman-Nicobar Islands.","India","12","93","","8.83899174412","92.2406633175","10.5751","94.0086"

Most of the sedimentary rocks of Small Nggela are early Miocene in age (dated by nannofossils and foraminifera). In the north, uniform volcaniclastic arenite (the Siota Beds) crops out. Much of the central, western and eastern parts of the island contain diverse strata including pillow lava, calcarenite, volcaniclastic arenite, grit and breccia (the Ghumba Beds). The Siota and Ghumba Beds, which are separated by a 1-1.5 km wide, east-trending ophiolite wedge, are considered to have been deposited in a forearc basin. The ophiolite wedge arrested the northward transport of coarse sediment and was emergent during the late Oligocene and early Miocene. The sediment and the ophiolite wedge are considered to have overlain a southward-descending Benioff zone. Well-bedded laminated arenite lacking basalt and rudite (the Ndandala Sandstone) is present in the south-western part of the island and is probably significantly younger than the underlying Ghumba Beds. A veneer of early-mid Pliocene limsteone (the Florida Limestone), representing a patch reef environment, was deposited upon the Ghumba Beds after they were folded.","Solomon Islands","-9.1333","160.3333","","-10.4247066576","163.520954596","-13.4759","160.696"

San Andres is a small coralline island 136 km east of the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. Surface mapping and paleontologic data indicate reefs have been growing actively in the area at least since early Miocene time. Because of the offlap relations of the ancient reef complexes, accessibility of progressively younger rocks is simplified.

Field and laboratory examination of both modern and ancient reef complexes indicates five major bottom facies: (1) forereef flank, (2) reef, (3) backreef platform, (4) backreef lagoon with patch reefs, and (5) shore area. Principal builders of the reefs were Millepora and lime-secreting algae with abundant Acropora, Diploria, Montastrea, and Porites.

From X-ray and petrographic studies of the limestones, a sequence of carbonate diagenesis has been determined for the San Andres area. During early stages of diagenesis, sediments initially are cemented by grain welding and aragonite precipitation between grains. This early type of cementation is most common in the supertidal and intertidal zones. Subsequent calcite cementation occurs by dissolution-precipitation after aragonite. After calcite precipitation, no evidence can be found of the preexisting aragonite cement. Although inversion of aragonite to calcite commonly occurs in grain material, dissolution-precipitation seems to be the major process of cementation.

During the diagenetic sequence, four responses may be expected: (1) magnesium is removed and high-magnesium calcite stabilizes to low-magnesium calcite, (2) aragonite can stabilize to calcite, (3) aragonite may be dissolved, and (4) sediments may become dolomitized. The time required for any of these reactions is variable and depends on the chemical environment. X-ray analyses indicate that all samples older than middle Pleistocene have stabilized to low-magnesium calcite or dolomite. The result of the diagenetic sequence is the development of a low-magnesium calcite limestone, a dolomite, or a combination of the two.

Porosity in the San Andres area is primary, secondary, or occluded and development depends on exposure of carbonate material to a subaerial environment before mineral stabilization occurs.","Colombia","12.5333","-81.7","73792","14.1707154333","-80.4236075757","12.4271","-80.2452"

This paper is a review of the present knowledge of coral reef ecology and paleoecology in the Hawaiian-Emperor
Chain during the last 70 Ma. Research on fossil coral deposits throughout the H-E Chain has played a major role in producing information concerning the subsidence, uplift and drowning of individual islands, as well as the  paleocirculation of the North Pacific Ocean during Tertiary time. The origin of the Hawaiian Islands and seamounts    over the Hawaiian hotspot and their subsequent subsidence and transport by plate motion to the north and northwest are reviewed and new data concerning uplift of the central high Hawaiian Islands caused by lithospheric flexure and the effect of sea level change on the geological evolution of individual islands are presented. The Darwin Point, where atolls drown to form guyots, is redefined in dynamic terms as a function of climate and sea level history. The absence of coral reefs during the first half of Hawaiian history is evidence ...","Pacific","42","170","","42","170","36.4277","-175.649"

Abstract of ref. 2126:
The Middle-Upper Devonian Kee Scarp reef complexes are oil-producing, stromatoporoid-dominated carbonates. Episodic increases in the rate of sea level rise produced multiple cycles of reef growth that exhibit backstepping characteristics. These carbonates have original interskeletal, intraskeletal, and intergranular porosity, mostly occluded by nonferroan, dull luminescent cements. Secondary porosity, represented by micropores of various types, developed during diagenesis by aggrading neomorphism and dissolution. The micropores represent the main reservoir porosity in the Kee Scarp limestone. Micropores in the Kee Scarp limestone can be classified into four categories based on their shapes.","Canada","65.2833","-126.8722","84237","9.19929760991","-114.586227328","-1.32714","-36.316"

The southern continental margin of Australia is the largest area of cool-water carbonate shelf deposition on the globe. Interpretation of 5495 km of airgun seismic-reflection data in the western part of the Great Australian Bight indicates that the 700-m-thick Cenozoic section of the offshore Eucla basin was deposited largely as a prograding cool-water, middle- to high-latitude carbonate ramp, characterized by widespread development of broad, low-relief, biogenic (bryozoan[?]-sponge), shelf and upper-slope mounds. The succession also contains a spectacular and extensive (>475 km long) buried middle Miocene barrier reef (the Miocene Little Barrier Reef) parallel to the modern shelf edge. This rimmed carbonate platform margin represents an episode of warm-water sedimentation during a global climatic optimum, probably coupled with strong eastward flow of a proto-Leeuwin Current. The late Miocene eustatic sea-level fall produced an areally restricted debris-apron sequence at the foot of the reef escarpment. The carbonate platform is capped by a Neogene cool-water carbonate ramp succession typified by aggradational to sigmoidal sequences, punctuated by periods of cold(?)-water, sea-floor erosion. Interpretation of this succession in the light of global and local tectonic and oceanographic events illustrates the dominant influence of water temperature on carbonate platform and reef growth throughout the Cenozoic.","Australia","-32.8333","127.5833","","-42.1422748319","125.052289145","-41.6208","123.72"

Ref. 1340:
Alternations of marine and meteoric diagenetic conditions, most probably caused by relative sea level fluctuations, are recorded in an Upper Triassic (Rhaetian) patch reef in the Calcare di Zu Formation, Lombardian Basin. Three main types of cements have been distinguished: 1) isopachous fibrous calcite cement, partially to completely filling mostly secondary solution cavities; 2) radial-fibrous calcite cement in which strongly turbid relics of precursor fibrous cements suggesting a neomorphic origin can be observed, and 3) equant spar calcite found both as a last cement occluding the remaining void space after the cementation by the fibrous cements and as a neomorphic product in corals.
Both marine and non-marine internal sediments are present in the patch reef. The marine internal sediments are composed of fecal pellets, peloids, micrite and bioclasts. They could be precedent, successive or contemporaneous to the isopachous marine cement and could have a geopetal disposition or may completely fill cavities. The observations made indicate that a 'peloidal texture' (a nucleus of anhedral HMC crystals from which fibrous crystals radiate) could result from the introduction of peloids/fine-grained micritic intraclasts into fibrous marine cements during their growth.
This texture has not been observed in geopetal infill peloids. Non marine internal sediments are composed of crystal silts and their deposition was preceded by the partial dissolution of the isopachous fibrous cements.","Italy","45.7722","9.4819","27537","23.8132295755","25.2057866985","32.2652","11.7884"

Abstract of ref. 1342:
Phosphatidized bioclastic limestomes of Early Tertiary age were dredged from the crest of a seamount in the equatorial Atlantic. The samples were recovered from water depths of 700-970 m but clearly were deposited in a high-energy reefal environment, thus indicating significant Tertiary subsidence. The vertical movement probably reflects reactivation of an old structural line, the Guinee Fracture Zone, which may have had important effects on the transfer of bottom waters of polar origin between the Sierra Leone and Gambia basins. Examination of foraminiferal limestone coating the shallow water material suggests that deep-water conditions were established on the seamount by Middle Miocene time. All phosphatized samples are covered with a layer of ferromanganese oxides which, from textural and faunal evidence, is Paleocene or Eocene in age and of shallow water origin. Pervasive phosphatiziation of the bioclastic limestones probably was accomplished before the end of the Eocene while the crest of the seamount was near sea level, because Upper Eocene limestone of shallow water facies is unaffected by such radical diagenesis. Phosphatization probably was associated with vigorous upwelling near the seamount and has been taken to an unusually advanced stage, resulting in a phosphorite of high economic grade. P2O5 contents are in the range of 37-41%. The purity of the phosphorites may be related to the intensity of upwelling during the Early Tertiary, but other factors such as the paucity of terrigenous detritus, frequent reworking of the sedimentary capping of the seamount, and a high primary porosity of the limestones may have been important in their formation. The Early Tertiary period of phosphorite deposition on the seamount and in northwest Africa ended before the close of Eocene time in both areas, while shallow water conditions prevailed. The cessation of phosphorite formation probably reflects major changes in the surface circulation of the Atlantic during the Eocene.","Atlantic","9.0236","-21.0403","","9.0236","-21.0403","6.05664","-26.3244"

Upper Jurassic (Oxfordian-Tithonian) reef-bearing carbonates are developed throughout the Ukrainian part of the Carpathian foredeep. These occupy an up to 50-km-wide area in which they attain thicknesses of 500-1000 m, occur at depths ranging between 1 and 7 km, and are covered Early Cretaceous to Miocene sediments. Upper Jurassic strata can be differentiated into reef-core, pre-reef, and back-reef facies.
Reservoir development occurs in the karstified, crestal parts of reefs (e.g., Kakhanovka and Letnya fields) and also in detrital back-reef carbonates (Rudky and Lopushnya fields). The potential of this oil and gas play is not yet exhausted, particularly in the area of back-reef facies development under the Carpathian thrust sheets.
Reservoir prediction is difficult due to insufficient core control and therefore is based on sedimentological log analyses. Different facies types are characterized by consistent well-log parameters, including shale content, primary and secondary carbonate texture, structure of associated lithotypes, etc. Different facies types can be correlated with characteristic log parameters. Nine facies types are recognized according to the scheme of J. L. Wilson. This opens the possibility to construct regional facies maps, to trace in time and space the development of the actual reef belt, and thus to enhance reservoir prediction. Sedimentological log analysis, combined with seismic criteria, proved to be an effective tool in the analysis of carbonate prospects, as evidenced by the discovery o the genetically unique Lopushnya field.
Regional paleosedimentological reconstructions of the Upper Jurassic basin form the basis for evaluating the remaining hydrocarbon potential of the back-reef facies domain in the Ukrainian part of the Carpathian foredeep and the adjacent Romanian territory.","Ukraine","48.0833","25.3333","","36.3936453641","38.618946782","27.7787","30.9172"

Abstract of ref. 1355:
Devonian reefs in Hunan were developed in the late Givetian and early Frasnian. Most reefs have been discovered in the area of carbonate platform facies and regarded as biostromes or patch reefs. Rare oil shows have been found in these kinds of reefs. Some so-called 'reef mounds' have abundant oil shows, but they have been considered to have developed only on a few elevated blocks in the area of inter-platform depressional facies. Based on research on reef distribution and characters of sedimentography and paleoecology, this paper proposes that many so-called 'biostromes' are not layered but instead are narrow along the edges of platforms as barrier reefs. Some 'reef mounds' are only the upper parts of barrier reefs, which extended towards the depressional facies area and were broken by faults. If this is true, they will be found along the edges of platforms and are not restricted within narrow limits. Because these parts of the reefs are preserved in the black shales and have fine oil shows, great attention should be paid to them in oil exploration.","China","27.7667","111.1667","","-14.6146245822","107.686763271","-3.94181","111.522"

Abstract of ref. 1595:
From four outcrops of the Portilla Fm. and one outcrop of the Candas Fm. in the W Cantabrian Mountains 17 species and subspecies of solitary and phaceloid rugose corals are described. They belong to 15 different genera. The stratigraphical classification of four of the localities in question as Upper  Givetian is confirmed by means of the identified coral faunas, and this age is also probable for the fifth locality. The rugose coral genera BREVISEPTOSIA n. gen. and SINAXIS n. gen. are erected in this paper; moreover the following 13 new species and subspecies are described and figured: Schindewolfia plena n. sp., Neaxon variabilis n. sp., Catactoechus bonarensis n. sp., Metrionaxon transitorius n. sp., Famennelasma antiquum n. sp., Breviseptosia pulchra n. gen. et n. sp., Sinaxis bulbosa n. gen. et. n. sp., Cyathophyllum (C.) postarduum n. sp., Thamnophyllum caespitosum leonense n. ssp., Acanthophyllum confusum n. sp., Stringophyllum buechelense cantabricum n. ssp., Stringophyllum crassimarginatum n. sp. and Solipetra fontainei n. sp. The number of genera and species of the normally ahermatypic classified small solitary corals without dissepimentarium is unusually great with respect to the  reef facies of the Portilla Formation. A part of them even occurs together with compact flat colonies of back reef corals of the 'reef  meadows' or even together with large solitary corals. So we have to assume that the 'Portilla environment' of the investigated localities was characterized by a very narrow-spaced irregular morphological pattern of its sea bottom.","Spain","43.5833","-5.7333","27605","-9.21243184235","-37.4038844209","-33.9828","22.6548"

8.3 m thick.

Abstract or ref. 1423:
Outcrop exposures along the Attawapiskat River in the Hudson Bay Lowlands of northern Ontario clearly reveal the morphology of Silurian (upper Llandoverian) reefs of the Attawapiskat Formation and the relationships between reef cores, flanking beds, and post-reef beds. These relationships indicate that the reefs had a syndepositional relief of at least 8-10 m. The relief of the reefs is indicated by debris-flow lenses encased within flanking beds, a debris-flow fan at the base of a reef, thin reef-flanking beds truncated against a vertical reef face, penecontemporaneous brachiopod beds on the flanks of reefs, and three large slide blocks that apparently slid over the side of a reef. Reefs of the Attawapiskat Formation are largely limestones with a wide range of lithologies. from stromatoporoid-, coral-, and cement-rich boundstones to alga- cement-rich boundstones. Thick, laterally extensive Nuia grainstone beds, a product of widespread Nuia monocultures in supratidal to intertidal ponds, are present above the reefs. The most important diagenetic processes were early marine cementation (predominantly radial-fibrous calcite), shallow burial diagenesis, and pervasive neomorphism. Schematic reconstructions of the depositional history of the Attawapiskat Formation in outcrop, constructed from observations of outcrop relationships, show a stratigraphic succession that was controlled by relative-sea-level changes. Reefs growth was terminated by a relative-sea-level fall, but subsequent minor relative-sea-level fluctuations resulted in alternating deposition of supratidal to shallow subtidal sediments for a short time before the final retreat of the Silurian seas from the Hudson Bay Platform; only supratidal evaporite facies are present in the remainder of the Silurian section above the Attawapiskat Formation.","Canada","52.8547","-83.7678","77260","-18.409510263","-93.7594475248","-14.087","-45.3129"

Abstract of ref. 1995:
Abstract: Several new occurrences of archaeocyathan-calcimicrobe-built reefs have been discovered in the upper Harkless Formation (Bonnia-Olenellus Zone) in
Esmeralda County, Nevada. Initial analyses of the paleoecology of these reefs show that the community structure consisted of several genera of archaeocyaths acting as the framework entity with calcimicrobes acting as the binding entity. Since the reefs are found in the upper Harkless, they are among the youngest known
metazoan-built reefs in western North America and represent the last pulse of metazoan reef building prior to their global disappearance in the Middle to Late
Cambrian. The mechanism or mechanisms that contributed to the demise of the metazoan reefs are unknown; therefore, we are studying these reefs in part to test hypotheses concerning the collapse of the Early Cambrian metazoan reef communities. 

These reefs contain the typical assemblage of Early Cambrian reef dwellers such as trilobites, echinoderms, and brachiopods; however, at one locality coralomorphs
are conspicuously present. These coralomorphs are approximately 12 cm long by 18 cm wide, are found scattered throughout the reefs, and constitute only a small percentage of the reef by volume. The coralomorphs have definite polygonal corallites which do not share walls, and resemble cerioid tabulate corals without obvious tabulae. Septa occur as obscure processes that project into the center of the corallites, dividing the corallites in half. These coralomorphs are similar to the genus Rosellatana, Kobluk, 1984 from the Lower Cambrian Cassiar Mountains of British Columbia.","United States","41.0333","-116.9833","81004","34.1473202567","-132.518514834","1.19637","-92.7579"

Abstract of ref. 1452: The Neoproterozoic-Cambrian succession in the Zavkhan Basin of western Mongolia preserves early Cambrian bioconstructions of Nemakit-Daldynian to Botomian age. As elsewhere (Siberia, Morocco), the Nemakit-Daldynian bioconstructions in the upper Tsagaan Gloom Formation to lower Bayan Gol Formation interval were purely calcimicrobial. Spectacular calcimicrobial 'patch reefs' of presumed Tommotian age are present in the lower Bayan Gol Formation. In contrast, late Atdabanian-early Botomian bioconstructions are varied and well developed in the upper Salaany Gol Formation including, in addition to calcimicrobial bioherms, Gordonophyton-Razumovskia crusts, radiocyathan-archaeocyathan bioherms and thickets of the ramose archaeocyath Cambrocyathellus.

Abstract of ref. 1501:
Middle and Late Cambrian reefs were built mainly by cyanobacterial communities. A few reefs with a metazoan as well as an algal component, however, are known from this interval. A Middle Cambrian reef formed primarily by spicular demosponges is described here from the Mila Formation in the Elburz Mountains, northern Iran. The reef is enclosed within calcareous grainstones which contain terminal Middle Cambrian (late Mayan) trilobites. The Mila Formation reef was constructed by sponges of the family Anthaspidellidae and bacterial (algal?) sheaths, and is the earliest metazoan reef to be documented from the interval after the demise of archaeocyath sponges. The reefal community is typical of subsequent reefal communities of Early-Middle Ordovician age. The Ordovician examples differ only by the incorporation of additional metazoan elements.","Iran","35.7167","52.2222","22821","-50.5213133874","68.1846854164","-13.8355","140.109"

Abstract ref. 1472:
 In December 1995 we dredged early Miocene coral-reef carbonates and early/middle Pliocene slope carbonates outcropping on the submerged Rama Ridge. This indicates that some of the Banda Sea Ridges were present during early Miocene times. Subsequent major tectonic subsidence occurred between middle Miocene and early Pliocene times. These results concur with the hypothesis of a relatively recent age for the North Banda Sea basement.","Indonesia","-5.5","127.5","70939","-5.5","127.5","-3.5296","131.387"

Abstract of ref. 1490
During the late middle Oxfordian, patch reefs grew on the northern margin of the Paris Basin. According to the facies analysis of the reef and inter-reef sediments, the environment was a warm, clear and agitated sea with highly episodic sedimentation. The bioherms were a short-lived phenomenon during the third phase of regional reefal development. Sequence stratigraphically, they are associated with a highstand system tract. Volumetrically and trophically dominant organisms were microbes now represented by massive clotted leiolite, 'stalactitic' hemispheroids with purely thrombolitic texture are restricted to open caves. Corals were of structural, reef-building importance due to their rapid upward growth. The patch reefs are characterised by thickets of ramose corals which developed a very open framework. In the vicinity of these patch reefs, though in hydrodynamically higher-energy environments, grew thickets of more stoutly branched corals. However, they are rarely preserved in situ and are generally represented as abundant coral rubble. The reef taxa are characterised by the notable absence of several groups (e.g. oysters, serpulids, bryozoans, pectinids) occurring at other localities where reefs of similar age developed in similar environmental conditions. The reefs also have strikingly modern aspects to them, in particular the presence of cryptic elements within caves and a sponge-dominated borer association. Dwellers belong to various life-form types although encrusting taxa are exceedingly rare. This may be explained by the presence of soft microbial films on most surfaces. The palaeoecological analysis suggests that the major controls on faunal composition and high diversity were elevated nutrient levels, highly episodic sedimentation and probably seasonal environmental disturbances. Structural and functional aspects of the reef community (grazers trigger framebuilders, borers trigger binders, binders hamper borers) allow ecological comparisons to be made with contemporaneous, as well as Recent, reefs. The unique combination of ecological factors resulted in a specialised, previously undescribed, community which differs from both Tethyan and northern localities in various aspects. These include cavities with cryptofauna, prominence of grazing gastropods and high faunal diversity in a microbially dominated build-up.","France","49.6056","4.4333","11084","34.3305365186","23.0173333059","40.3824","13.6531"

Abstract of ref. 1504:
Twenty six species of archaeocyaths are described (seven in open nomenclature), including Naimarkcyathus elenae gen. et sp. n. representing a new family Naimarkcyathidae and superfamily Naimarkcyathoidea of the order Archaeocyathida, from the Cambrian limestone erratics in the glacio-marine sediments of the Oligocene Polonez Cove and Early Miocene Cape Melville Formations on King George Island (South Shetland Islands, West Antarctica). They are accompanied by coralomorphs and calcified cyanobacteria. The archaeocyathan assemblage closely resembles allochthonous assemblages from the Weddell Sea and Whichaway Nunataks. Current reconstructions of icestream movement and iceberg drift, and similarities in species composition, suggest the Argentina Range limestones as a source of these erratics. The species Stapicyathus stapipora, Prethmophyllum subacutum, Aporosocyathus mucroporus, 'Mennericyathus' dissitus, Paranacyathus sarmaticus and Archaeopharetra irregularis are added to the list of common species for Antarctica and Australia. The total list of the common Australian-Antarctic archaeocyaths now include 31 of all of the 52 well defined Antarctic species. The archaeocyaths of King George Island, and Early Cambrian Antarctic archaeocyath assemblages (except these of the Mt. Egerton in the Byrd Glacier area) are of uppermost Botomian age (Syringocnema favus Beds) as in South Australia. This means that archaeocyaths did not reach Antarctica until latest Botomian time. Erratic blocks containing archaeocyaths represent various reef facies similar to the Shackleton Limestone facies and those of South Australia. The occurrence of small shelly fossils (Dailyatia ajax, ? Byronia sp., Halkieria parva, Thambetolepis delicata and Albrunicola bengtsoni) which are typical of the Parara Limestone, of the Syringocnema favus archaeocyathan assemblage, and of Hadimopanella antarctica and certain brachiopods in erratics of different lithologies, suggests a very similar faunal and facies succession for Antarctica and South Australia and therefore, a comparable basin history.","Argentina","-82","-50","62871","-24.081443656","142.454928835","-13.4468","-147.901"

Abstract of ref. 1534:
Phosphorite grains were authigenically precipitated within
precursor marl and biosiliceous deposits during high water level and
intense upwelling within the Tethys Ocean to the north of Jordan. With
falling sea level, the oyster Lopha villei colonized bathymetric highs in the shallow shelfal environments in east-central Jordan during the uppermost Campanian--Lower Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous). The oyster bioherms in the epeiric southern shelf of the Tethys formed small basins several hundreds of meters across and about 40--50 m deep. Under these lowstand conditions, oyster shells were shed off the bioherms and deposited as large cross-bedded units on the flanks of the basins. At the same time, precursor phosphatic sediments were reworked and winnowed to form high-grade phosphorite sand. More than 250 million metric tons (250 x 109 kilograms) of phosphorite sand were deposited basinward of the oyster beds. As sea level continued to fall, the oyster bioherms formed partially silled basins with low biological diversity in which marl and/or bituminous marl was deposited. The marls are overlain by the transgressive phosphatic marl and chalk of the Muwaggar Formation, which were deposited under open marine conditions.","Jordan","31.05","36.0833","","17.2739026154","30.406601367","12.9001","31.5775"

Abstract ref. 1551:
Miospores from boreholes through the earliest sediments associated with the onset of the formation of reef complexes on the Lennard Shelf of northern Western Australia include representatives of the Geminospora lemurata-Cymbosporites magnificus and Contagisporites optivus-Cristatisporites triangulatus Assemblage Zones. The palynofloral evidence indicates that deposition of the reef sequence began in the mid-Givetian, rather than latest Givetian as previously thought. Palynomorphs become sparser with increase in carbonate content and consequently middle Frasnian to Famemmian palynomorph zones cannot be distinguished in the reef complexes.","Australia","-19","127","","-32.8144857777","152.063688863","-17.7809","135.25"

Abstract of ref. 1560:
Mud-mound complexes identified within the early to middle Ashgill Cystoid Limestone Formation of northeastern Spain are the first fossil build-ups to be described in the high latitude north-facing margin of Gondwana. Mud-mound complexes comprise individual lenticular mounds (composed of floatstones, cephalopod-rich mudstones and cementstones), flanks and intermound deposits (including pelmatozoan packstones and floatstones). The small mounds are mainly composed of bryozoans, cystoids and crinoids, and were developed on outer ramp environments. Mound initiation depended upon the stabilization and colonization of densely packed lenses of pelmatozoan-rich sediments. In a mid-ramp setting, pelmatozoan-bryozoan meadows were episodically degraded by common wave- and storm-induced processes, the
development of semi-consolidated substrates, and the periodic influx of terrigenous material. Finally, during the Hirnantian regression, the Iberian mixed (carbonate-siliciclastic) platform was exposed to subaerial conditions sufficiently for erosion and karstification to occur.
From a palaeogeographical point of view, the pattern of the Ashgill Iberian platform deposition is characterized by episodic exclusion of carbonates from most nearshore environments by a shoreline source of siliciclastic sediments. A similar interpretation to that made on the Iberian Cystoid Limestone Formation, in terms of gradual proximality-distality changes, is proposed for comparable facies types in Ashgill limestones described in southwestern Europe.","Spain","41.1472","-1.1861","80725","-71.8835031325","10.7204725912","-74.9431","79.6047"

Outer Shelf edge buildup.
Together with upper Member B about 1.5 km syndepositional relief.
Fenestral pelmicrite and fenestral pelsparite predominate. Calcimicrobes associated: Halysis, cf. Hedstroemia, Epiphyton, Renalcis, Girvanella. 
Up to 30 % early marine cement.

Abstract of ref. 1574:
Four Lower Ordovician buildup categories occur in carbonate platform strata in the Canadian Arctic Islands: outer and inner shelf-margin buildups and outer and inner shelf-interior buildups. The outer shelf-margin buildup in the Bulleys Lump Formation consists mainly of calcirnicrobial biolithite and early marine cement, forming a structure that probably had a depositional relief of more than 1.5 km over contiguous basinal chert and mudrock. The length of the outer shelf-margin buildup is probably more than 1400 km, although it is discontinuously exposed. Inner shelf-margin buildups are smaller, mounded structures, attaining thicknesses in excess of 100 m and widths of several kilometres. A representative inner shelf-margin buildup comprises four distinct microbial facies; the stratigraphically lowest and deepest water facies contains up to 4 m-thick thrombolite mounds surrounded by Conophyton-like stromatolitic pinnacles. The two middle facies consist of numerous, aligned ovoidal thrombolites with thromboidal or columnar stromatolitic interiors and stromatolitic margins. Thrombolites were built mainly by benthic microbial communities, but fleshy and locally well-sclerotized sponges were probably important constructors as well. These thrombolites are overlain by the shallowest water and youngest buildup facies, consisting of cerebroform stromatolites and thrombolites, but which lack the distinctive ovoidal thrombolites of the underlying facies. Zoned inner shelf-margin microbial buildups such as these are previously undocumented. Shelf-interior buildups are composed of thrombolites and stromatolites, forming isolated, I to 5 m-high mounds and coalesced mounds in buildups more than 2.0 km wide. The distribution of the four buildup categories implies a shelf-margin embayment in the central part of the Arctic Islands.","Canada","80.75","-69.25","","25.5052732236","-64.8753895932","-7.99414","-39.3674"

Abstract ref. 1597:
The Cliefden Caves area of central New South Wales has a well preserved Late Ordovician sedimentary succession that formed in an offshore, near-equatorial, volcanic island setting. Initially fringing deposits (the Fossil Hill Limestone) accumulated, with occurrences of corals such as Tetradium cribriforme, Nyctopora, Bajgolia, Dualites, Hillophyllum, and stromatoporoids like Cystistroma, Rosenella and Stratodictyon. These were particularly characteristic of the shoal-type, mid-shelf T. cribriforme biofacies, and were contributors to a number of bioherms and biostromes. The succeeding, massive Belubula Limestone accumulated mainly in shallow lagoonal phases of the planated island with only sparse heliolitine corals, Aulopora, Bajgolia?, the stromatoporoids Cystostroma and Alleynodictyon? and the sphinctozoan sponge Belubulaia. The overlying deeper platform carbonates of the Vandon Limestone have a more diverse fauna with T. cribriforme, numerous heliolitines, Palaeophyllum, the sphinctozoan Cliefdenella, and stromatoporoids (Ecclimadictyon, Clathrodictyon), but no indubitable 'reefs'. Deep water assemblages of the overlying Malongulli Formation include reworked and in situ siliceous sponge associations. Limestone breccias include: (1) clasts with corals (Favistina and favositids) and rare silicified sphinctozoans, presumed to be derived from the adjacent shallow platform; and (2) clasts eroded from the slopes, with a diverse assemblage of demosponges, hexactinellids and discrete spicules. The in situ Malongulli assemblage occupied a lower slope/basin position, and includes undescribed hexactinellids and abundant spicules. A striking onshore-offshore faunal differentiation exists, with (1) the corals and stromatoporoids, most diversified and abundant in the mid-shelf island settings above wave base, (2) the sphinctozoans, rare constituents of lagoonal to subtidal 'level bottom' carbonate platform habitats, (3) the demosponges, most common and diversified in the upper slope, and (4) the hexactinellids, well represented in both upper and lower slope /basin habitats.","Australia","-33.6","148.8667","2647","12.7698326841","119.100033359","16.6399","177.566"

Abstract ref. 1606.
In the following 31 brachiopod genera and 56 species from the Heller Crinoidenschutt- und Riffkalk of the Seewarte
    Mt. are described. They belong to the superfamilies Pentameracea, Rhynchonellacea, Atrypacea, Retziacea,
    Athyridacea, Cyrtiacea, Spiriferacea, Crytinacea and Reticulariacea. Pugnax ? scupini is erected as a new species.
    Uncinulus sp., Parapugnax sp., Stenorhynchia aff. nympha, Atrypa (Planatrypa) n. sp., Carinatina n. sp., Rhynchatrypa
    aff. thetis and Striispirifer sp. are listed under open nomenclature because they require a future more complete
    investigation based on additional material. The brachiopod-fauna of the Carnic Alps is closely related to that of the Barandian area. This relation becomes most obvious when compared to the brachiopod community of the Pragian Koneprusy Limestones of Central Bohemia. Furthermore the connections to Lower Devonian brachiopod assemblages of the Ural, Altai and Salair (USSR) can be demonstrated. The faunas of the Armorican Massiv (Limestones of Erbray, Trench of La Lezais), Marokko (Limestones of the Tafilalt) and the Harz Mts. (Princeps-Limestone) are also comparable to that of the Carnic Alps.","Austria","46.6667","12.9167","77909","46.6667","12.9167","-41.6809","51.8775"

Abstract of ref. 1610:
The Member U-III a of the Upper Himenoura Subgroup distributed in Kumamoto and Kagoshima Prefectures is composed mainly of cross-bedded sandstone, which yields two oyster beds. Autochthonous oyster reefs can be observed at two outcrops exposed at Onoura in Amakusa-Shimojima and Hirasezaki in Shimokoshikijima (Fig.1). These oysters are 'mudstickers' (Seilacher et al., 1985), and are assigned to one of the Crosssostrea species. They are divided into two distinct morphotypes, namely, a stocky form (Onoura type; about 30 cm in shell height) and a stick-like elongated form (Hirasezaki type; less than 100 cm in height). The Onoura type seems to adopt 'relay-strategy', and one clump usually consists of three or four generations. On the other hand, the Hirasezaki type resembles morphologically solitary mudstickers such as Konbostrea. However, this Hirasezaki type also make the clump composed of three or four generations. The Hirasezaki type may, therefore, adopt not only 'elongated-strategy' but also 'relay-strategy'. This is an intermediate mode of life between Crassotrea and Konbostrea. Sedimentological analysis suggests that the Cretaceous strata exposed at Onoura represent more nearshore facies than those at Hirasezaki. The Onoura type might be adapted to nearshore, lagoonal environments, while the Hirasezaki type might be an adaptive form to offshore bar in open marine environments. Cretaceous gigantic oyster beds are confined to three stages in Japan: middle Cenomanian, upper Turonian to lowest Santonian, and upper Campanian.","Japan","32.3333","130.1667","","38.7164553156","129.223640416","39.0273","120.135"

Abstract of ref. 1617:
Heliolitine corals occur in Upper Silurian strata of the topmost Douro, lower Barlow Inlet, and lower Somerset Island formations in the Boothia Uplift region. The fauna includes Heliolites (nine species), Propora (two species), the stelliporellid genera Ponollites (three species) and Stelliporella (one species), and the plasmoporid Squameolites (one species). Species present but not previously reported from the region include Heliolites arcuatus Bondarenko, Heliolites uksunayensis Mironova, Stelliporella ilensis Bondarenko, Podollites assitus new species, Podollites parryi new species, Podollites plectilis new species, Propora tubulata (Lonsdale) and an unidentified species of Propora. All species occur in reef and reef-associated facies of open carbonate shelf and ramp settings. In restricted nonreefal carbonate shelf settings, diversity attenuates to a minimum, exemplified by numerically abundant monospecific assemblages of Heliolites uksunayensis. Six of the 16 morphotaxonomic units recognized compare with species reported previously in Silurian faunas of Kazakhstan and Mongolia. Combinations of characters in the species attributed to Podollites support revision of the genus, possibly to include Derivatolites and Tarbagatailites, in a group morphologically intermediate between Stelliporella and Heliolites.","Canada","74.5333","-95.3","5796","5.52735635473","-73.3948069698","2.7265","-30.9537"

50 coral species recorded in total.

Ref. 1902 recorded only 5 genera and 8 species of corals.

Abstract of ref. 1862:
Caribbean coral reefs were widespread, well developed, and highly diverse during the Late Oligocene. In contrast, the Early Miocene was marked by decline in both reef building and reef-coral diversity. Increasing planktonic productivity has been implicated in this regional collapse of the coral reef ecosystem. Reduction of extensive reef development makes it difficult to find early Neogene corals to sample, but the abundant and well preserved corals from the Tamana Fm. of Trinidad are one exception. The goal of this study was to more fully document this important fauna and better constrain the timing and effects of the Oligocene/Miocene biotic transition. Large new collections from the Tamana Fm. indicate that extinction was nearly complete and that recovery of coral species diversity was well under way by the beginning of the Middle Miocene. A total of 33 species were recovered from the Tamana Fm. Thirteen of these species are first occurrences (40 percent), but only four are last occurrences (12 percent). Three of the four last occurrences have only been recognized from the Tamana Fm., and may represent taxonomic uncertainty. The first occurrences include taxa destined to be major constituents of Miocene and Pliocene coral communities, including several species of Montastraea, Caulastraea portoricensis, Agaricia undata, and Siderastrea siderea. In spite of this increasing diversity, significant reef tract development did not return to the Caribbean until after a major episode of extinction during Plio/Pleistocene time. This second extinction decimated the diverse Late Pliocene fauna, and is associated with oceanographic changes caused by the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama and intensification of northern hemisphere glaciation. Therefore the Oligocene/Miocene transition was characterized by a decline in both reef building and reef-coral diversity but the Plio/Pleistocene transition was associated with decreasing diversity and increasing reef development. Both reef coral diversity and reef-tract development are strongly influenced by oceanographic conditions, but their responses are not in phase.","Trinidad and Tobago","10.5","-61.3333","27596","11.0095244655","-58.6207389119","10.1867","-58.8035"

Abstract of ref. 1628:
Cladocora caespitosa is a common zooxanthellate, ahermatypic, constructional scleractinian coral in shallow waters of the present-day Mediterranean. Extensive coral banks in Upper Pliocene shallow marine deposits of the Almería-Níjar Basin (SE Spain) contain the same species. These banks occur on debris-flow conglomerates deposited in a fan delta, or on bioclastic accumulations interpreted as storm deposits. Direct relationships of coral beds with coastal facies indicate that C. caespitosa colonized shallow settings near the paleocoast, probably not deeper than 20-30 m. Low turbulence allowed corals to colonize substrates, which remained stable for long periods. Activity of organisms in the coral community, storms, and detritic discharges from the fan delta were the most significant mechanisms disturbing the coral development. The hard substrata provided by coral banks promoted colonization by cemented and epibyssate organisms. Coral banks marked maximum flooding surfaces at the end of transgressive systems tracks. They were suddenly buried by sediment input into the basin. Taphonomic signatures measured on components of the coral bank communities indicate a low turbulence environment, probably a bay. The low hydraulic energy further inhibited post-burial reworking, thus promoting the in situ preservation of a great part of the organisms inhabiting the bioconstructions.","Spain","36.9","-2.2833","71144","36.7802759692","-2.32245922077","36.9676","-2.54248"

From Copper
a late Caradoc, possibly  also (?) Ashgill microbial mudmound reef tract from the Anderken Fm., with dasyclad green algae, is described (Nikitin, 1973; Nikitin et al., 1974; Nikitin et al, 1996). One reef is c.150m thick and about1500m across. Such reefs have physical similarities with those of the Boda Limestone of Sweden. The age of some of these mounds is not firmly established for some of the Caradoc mounds may be partly of Ashgill age. The Betpak-Dala locality  is the central part of the arcuate Ordovician reef tract, with a southern extension for 600km to southern Kazakhstan,  at the northern Tyan Shan range (Chon-Kemi River, N of Issuk-Kul Lake, near Alma-Ata).

11 identified reef building genera

Also Webby, pers. comm.:
The 80-m thick reef-bearing interval at Dongzhuang comprises six superposed reefs, the lower, a  large, 30 m-high, wedge-shaped shelf-edge reef, bounded top and bottom by massively bedded, calcarenitic, bank-type deposits, and dominated by 'algal' constituents (Solenopora, Palaeoporella, Ajakmalajsoria), and cyanophytes (Hedstroemia, Girvanella) that contributed mainly a bafflestone facies. Basin-facing, outer flanks of this reef show wedge-shaped talus, up to 30 m thick, with clasts up to 80 mm across.  

The rest of the reefal series comprises back-stepping, partially stacked, patch reefs, dominantly of coral, stromatoporoid and stromatolitic contributors. They have an overall thickness of 40 m and a width of more than 100 m. Corals include rugosan Favistina, and tabulates Paleofavosites, Syringoporella and Halysites. The stromatoporoids are Ecclimadictyon and Clathrodictyon, characteristically sheet-like to more massive. The flanking bioclastic limestones include clasts with pelmatozoan debris, brachiopod fragments, gastropods, bryozoans and 'algae'. All these reefs, except the first which is small (2 m high) and stromatolitic, include corals and stromatoporoids, and they are 3 to 4 m high, with flanking (and enveloping) rudstones. The series appears to represent a shelf-edge complex with back-stepping, asymmetrical form, between a thick rudstone blanket on-shelf, and a narrow rudstone halo to the deeper transgressing shales of slope and basin.","China","34.5","108.8333","","37.6924748534","92.0176068894","-26.0816","122.547"

A spectacular Middle and late Givetian coral- stromatoporoid patch reef belt, paralleling the Precambrian basement some 50-100km to the south, is known to extend for c. 300km in the Tindouf basin of northern Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (='Spanish Sahara': Hazzard,1961; Dumestre & Illing,1967), These tabular to mounded reefs were up to c. 2km across, and tens of meters thick, capped by a rich shallow water coral and stromatoporoid fauna, in the region from Uein Terguet to Gor Loutad. 
Stromatactis mudmounds with auloporids and thamnoporids, like those of the Kess-Kess of the Tafilalt, are also known at Uein Terguet, where they appear to initiate reef growth in the 'first cycle' (Dumestre & Illing, 1967).","Morocco","26.5167","-11.3833","79555","-40.3204967253","-17.416223553","-45.955","5.82402"

A Trypanites-bored discontinuity surface separates the micritic crust from flanking pelmatozoan bioclastic limestones. Pelmatozoans are thought by Dronov and Federov to have grown on the atoll-like micritic rim, as baffles to the inner lagoonal mud core.

At Ullerntangen the bioclastic limestone sequence with its small mud  mounds is overlain by a very much larger, lens-shaped buildup, at least 350 m in length, 100 m in width, and up to 12 m in thickness.  It was originally interpreted as a reef by Kiaer (1897) but Hanken (1974) has argued that it lacks an organic framework, being largely composed of reworked material.
Nevertheless a remarkably diverse biota is recorded from this structure, including the stromatoporoid Pachystylostroma, rugoans Palaeophyllum,
Cyathophylloides, Tryplasma, tabulatans Saffordophyllum,  Rhabdotetradium, Lyopora, Reuschia, Catenipora, Proheliolites and Plasmpora as well as exhibiting pockets with clusters of cystoids and trimerellid brachiopod specimens.  The comparatively random directions of orientation of many of the coral and stromatoporoid specimens on the present exposed, slightly inclined, surface are not by themselves a certain basis for claiming that these organisms, or a substantial number of them, were not part of an in situ framework. Almost half the muddy matrix is composed of skeletal bioclasts - predominantly representatives of pelmatozoans, brachiopods, bryozoans, algae (Vermiporella, Hedstroemia) and the cyanobacterieum Girvanella.  The upper surface of the mound is cut by deep fissures up to 6 m deep, that imply a period of significant erosion possibly under subaerial conditions, and then they were infilled by sandy pelmatozoan-dominated bioclastic limestone in a subsequent depositional phase.  Finally a further sandstone unit overlaps the mound on its northern margin, and exhibits a very rich brachiopod, bryozoan and gastropod fauna near the mound.  This unit represents the uppermost part of the unnamed formation, and appears to be bounded at its top by a significant unconformity (hiatus) to the overlying Silurian Saelabonn Formation.","Norway","60.1333","10.1333","","-23.4987246045","-63.2650555473","-28.8019","-9.25712"

Abstract ref. 1770:
Maastrichtian strata from the Pachino area (SE Sicily) provide a model of association between rudist-coral frameworks and submarine volcanic activity. Two successive carbonate units are distinguished: (a) Coral- rudist bioherms and biostromes developed in a high-energy environment. (b) Hippuritid build-ups and banks overlain by rudist-coral clusters which grew under harsher ecological conditions, in a weaker current regime. At the top of the Maastrichtian sequence, the growth of rudist-coral frameworks ceased as ecological conditions shifted toward restricted environments. The inferred succession reflects a gradual decrease in current strengths and water depths, related to the Maastrichtian regression phase. The frameworks display consistent evolutionary sequences reflecting progressive changes in their biota, structure, and size and shape. Occurrences of rudist-coral frameworks are clearly linked with submarine volcanoes which provided opportunities for their development; they sometimes grew in the vicinity of active-vent centers, a feature reported for the first time in the Upper Cretaceous.","Italy","36.6833","15.1333","74623","28.446940629","13.2700613165","24.7057","12.797"

The described biolithitic complex belongs to the sedimentation model characteristic for the subduction zone with an island arc system. The boundary Cretaceous-Tertiary is found everywhere in the Dinarides marked by a significant biostratigraphic discontinuity, and in terms of lithostratigraphy, by a continuity or discontinuity depending on geotectonical events.

The 1st paleontologically confirmed occurrence of Upper Cretaceous sediments in the Little Carpathians was described. A series of strata of carbonate-sandstones through fine grained conglomerates of the Campanian with large Foraminifera of the genera Orbitoides, Pseudosidlerites and Lepidorbitoides was exposed on the southern slope of Vapenkova skala near Rozbehy. Bodies of biohermal reef limestone with corals and Dasycladaceae, probably of the Maastrichtian, were found on the walls of the Campanian strata. The find represents an important connecting link between the Brezova development of the Upper Cretaceous and Senonian sediments found to exist on the floor of the Vienna basin in drillings in the area of Zavod and Studienka.

Abstract of Ref. 1821:
Paleocological analysis of the reef community shows that, apart from corals, it was dominated by epifaunal molluscs. It represents one of the most diverse fossil communities found on Cyprus following the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC), with 38 identified species of macrofossils and 8 species of foraminifera. When compared to patch reefs on Cyprus formed just prior to the MSG, this Pliocene reef shows both the biological devastation of the event and the quick and complete recovery of the reefal biodiversity.","Cyprus","35.0961","33.1486","34689","34.4068011008","32.9725007824","35.0008","33.1104"

The stratigraphy and structure of the Lower Cretaceous (Aptian-Albian) rocks exposed in the area of Lampazos, Sonora, are redefined and correlated to well-known stratigraphic successions of Chihuahua and northeast Mexico (Coahuila and Nuevo Leon). Originally, seven stratigraphic units were proposed for the Cretaceous rocks exposed in the Lampazos area, but in this article only five units (El Aliso, Agua Salada, Lampazos, Espinazo del Diablo, and Los Picachos formations) have been used, and we propose herein to discontinue usage of the other two (Nogal and La Mesa formations). This Aptian-Albian succession of east-central Sonora yields facies and fossil content remarkably similar to coeval sequences in the Gulf of Mexico realm (Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Nuevo Leon). These sections contain abundant microfossils (benthic and planktonic foraminifera, colomiellids, nannoconids, and radiolarians) that permit detailed biostratigraphic determinations. A complete Aptian-lower Albian section (base of K-6 through top of K-15 of the biochronologic scheme of Longoria, 1984) was identified. Abrupt lithic changes through the Aptian-Albian section of Lampazos revealed three major paleoceanographic events having an overall regional marine transgression, including an early Aptian (K-6 to K-7) event, a late Aptian (K-10 to K-11) event, and an early Albian (K-13 to K-14) maximum flooding phase. We used physical and biochronologic data to tie the aforementioned events to geochemically constrained Aptian-Albian oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) in Santa Rosa Canyon of Nuevo Leon.

The close correlation between the oceanic events in east Sonora (northwest Mexico) and central Nuevo Leon (northeast Mexico) invokes the closer paleogeographic development of the two regions (Begin page 1812) and undoubtedly links the area of Lampazos to a rapid encroachment of the paleo-Gulf of Mexico through north-central Mexico (the Mexican Sea) into northwestern Mexico (Chihuahua trough and Sonoran basin). The early Aptian (biozones K-6 to K-7) transgression has its maximum extension during the early Albian (biozones K-13 to K-14), culminating with the drowning of the carbonate platforms.

The Lower Cretaceous rocks exposed in the Lampazos area are complexly folded and faulted. The more conspicuous structures are isoclinal and box-shaped folds and thrust faults, mostly oriented north-south and northwest-southeast, having vergences to both the northeast and southwest. A very conspicuous feature is the opposite vergence of thrust faults, either converging or diverging. Two dextral strike-slip faults (northeast-southwest and east-west) separate the area into three large blocks that have different patterns of folds and thrust faults. Also, it is evident that the area was affected by at least two episodes of normal faulting. Furthermore, the structural style of deformation present in the Lampazos succession is remarkably similar to the style of deformation of coeval rocks in northeastern Mexico, especially to the structure of the Chihuahua tectonic belt. The Lampazos succession is paleogeographically and tectonically related to the Chihuahua tectonic belt, and it is considered to be the westernmost extension of the ancestral Gulf of Mexico.

The fact that the Lampazos succession can be lithocorrelated to known sequences in northeastern Chihuahua (Lucero, Ahumada, and Loma Plata formations) and northeast Mexico (Cupido, San Angel, La Pe±a, and Tamaulipas formations), which are know to be source rocks in exploration wells in Nuevo Leon and Coahuila, makes the Lampazos area of Sonora potentially attractive as an exploration target.","Mexico","29.2","-109.5","21255","31.1737282779","-71.5115420725","30.1913","-70.1126"

Abstract 1835:
Carbonate mounds within the Chesterian (Mississippian) Bangor Limestone in north Alabama and east Tennessee are few in number, but diverse in character. Fourteen known mounds in this area can be assigned to five categories: 1) stromatolitic, 2) mud, 3) bryozoan-crinoid-coral, 4) bryozoan-crinoid, and 5) coral. Stromatolitic and mud mounds are microbial, bryozoan-crinoid-coral mounds are biodetrital, and coral mounds and some bryozoan-crinoid mounds are biohermal (reefal). Three lensoid stromatolites within crinkly-laminated dolomudstone comprise a single mound horizon about 0.5 m thick east of Monteagle, Tennessee. Near Haletown, Tennessee, the Bangor Limestone contains two mud mounds. The largest measures 8.2 m across and contains articulated bivalves and brachiopods, and intact fenestrate bryozoans. The mound's upper surface is bored. The mud matrix appears to contain tubular microfossils resembling Renalcis. A single bryozoan-crinoid-coral mound has been identified in Lawrence County, Alabama. It is approximately 25 m wide, up to 1.6 m thick, and had a maximum of 45 cm of synoptic relief. This mound is dominated by in situ colonies of the large rugosan Caninia sp. in a matrix of fenestrate bryozoan and echinoderm debris. A bryozoan-crinoid mound about 0.7 m thick and 1.5 m wide near Blount Springs, Alabama, contains a framework of fenestrate bryozoans and serpulids, spar-filled voids, and skeletal debris dominated by echinoderm ossicles. Bryozoan-crinoid mounds about 2 m thick have been reported from the Bangor-Pennington transition zone east of Monteagle. Five mounds up to 15 m wide and up to 1.5 m thick that are constructed entirely by Caninia sp. are known near Blount Springs and Lacon, Alabama.   Bangor mounds are relatively rare and small, suggesting environmental stress. The mounds we examined are mostly underlain by packstone/grainstone, which suggests that the principal stressor might have been a mobile substrate coupled with periodic smothering. However, the Lawrence County mound is underlain by oolitic grainstone that had first been indurated during a period of early subaerial exposure. Early diagenesis or other stabilization mechanisms probably occurred at the other mound sites as well.","United States","35.0333","-85.5333","","-16.3376633527","-65.9145290523","-17.7191","-31.6048"

Abstract ref. 1836:
Abstract: Mesozoic carbonate accumulations are rare in northwestern Pangea. This is due, initially to the demise of many carbonate secreting organisms during the terminal Permian biotic crisis and subsequently, to increased clastic sedimentation resulting from the tectonic development of western North America. Ecological voids resulting from the extinction however resulted in new opportunities for surviving taxa. Terebratulid brachiopod-echinoderm dominated biostromes within the primarily siliciclastic Liard Formation ( Middle Triassic, Ladinian) of northeastern British Columbia provide an example of this.  The Liard biostromes are composed primarily of whole and unabraded terebratulid brachiopods, articulate crinoid elements and cidaroid echinoid spines and interambulacral plates. Many of the terebratulid brachiopods are characterized by the pedicle attachment trace fossil Podichnus. Other organisms which occupied the biostromes include acrotretid and spiriferid brachiopods, bivalves, and gastropods, as well as rare bryozoans, oysters and possibly scleractinian corals.  Sedimentary units deposited on the margins of the biostromes are characterized by an abundance of body fossils (decapod crustaceans, bivalves and ophiuroids) and trace fossils (i.e. Asterosoma, Cylindrichnus, Palaeophycus, Rosselia, Teichichnus and Thalassinoides). This trace fossil assemblage contains a mix of horizontal and vertical deposit feeding organisms, consistent with deposition in a lower shoreface setting. Hiatal surfaces and laterally restricted bioclastic sandstone layers and lenses within these features suggests that frequent turnover of infaunal and epifaunal communities occurred at the edges of the Liard brachiopod-echinoderm biostromes.  Environmental/ecological criteria essential for the development of the Liard biostromes include: a) initial storm-induced concentration of shell material to create islands or zones of comparably stable substrate, thus promoting colonization by crinoids, terebratulid brachiopods, and cidaroid echinoids; b) a temporary decrease in siliciclastic input to the shoreface, allowing biostrome building organisms the chance to colonize these patches of stable substrate, and dominate deposition within the lower shoreface, and c) aerobic conditions in the lower shoreface allowing for a healthy and robust biostrome fauna.","Canada","56.05","-122.7167","44367","33.1619916288","-38.8109930222","24.0144","-37.2883"

Ref. 1843:
The Early Silurian is a critical time for understanding the evolution of corals and their role as reef-builders. By the middle Early Silurian, corals and stromatoporoids were the primary reef-building organisms. The Brassfield Formation (Llandoverian) in southwestern Ohio consists principally of nearshore bioclastic grainstones and packstones with occasional boundstones and minor shale intervals. Numerous coral-stromatoporoid patch reefs reported from the Brassfield are among the oldest known in the United States. Unlike other Silurian reefs in the U.S., Brassfield reefs are undolomitized and well-preserved. These conditions allow observation of fine-scale morphological details and permit a detailed taxonomic and paleoecologic comparison with other Silurian reef communities.  Fossil material (in situ and from float) was collected from a Brassfield patch reef exposed in the Reed North Quarry, Fairborn, Greene County, Ohio. Approximately 350 fossil specimens were identified during preliminary mapping of at least 72 square meters of the patch reef. In order of abundance, the reef-building organisms include favositids (176 colonies), stromatoporoids (109 specimens), colonial rugosans (37 specimens), halysitids (16 colonies), and solitary rugosans (9 specimens). A few specimens have encrusting crinoid or bryozoan holdfasts. Initial observations indicate that this Brassfield patch reef is consistent with the model of a typical Early Silurian reef.","United States","39.8139","-83.9833","22964","-29.9460684846","-103.946697039","-24.4348","-54.036"

The Upper Permian in South Mexico includes the Olinala Formation in the state of Guerrero. This formation is the youngest Paleozoic sedimentary cover of the Mixteco Terrane. This formation contains the youngest Permian beds reported in Mexico (Woardian, Capitanian). The lower and middle part, containg fosilss of goniatits, of Woardian age, consists of silisiclastic rocks, while the upper part is a carbonate sequence of Late Guadalupean age. The carbonate sequence overlies the siliciclastic sequence by erosional contact. This carbonate sequence is a ramp deposit, the inner shallow ramp deposits are mainly composed of echinoderm debris grainstone-packstones, in which are found, crinoids, pelecypods, gastropods, as well as microfossils such as Parachaetes sp, seaweed (Tubhyfites sp; Tubhyfites obscurus Maslov 1956), boundstones type LLH(C), and organic bank crinoids boundstones and shoal bioclastic grainstones.  The middle ramp is characterized by interbeded finegrained limestones and sandstones. The limestones are bioclastic packstone-wackestones with echinoid fragments (crinoids mainly), bryozoa, pelecypod shells of, brachiopod spines, small Foraminifera (Abadehella ex gr.coniformis) and fusulinids (Codonofusiela extensa Skinner& Wilde, 1955; Rauserella errática, Dumbar 1944, Condofusiella extensa Skinner & Wilde 1955) of Woardian-Capitanian age. The sanstones are litarenites and sub litarenites.  The deep ramp deposits consist of carbonate mud mount of cyanobacterium (Tubiphytes, Aelisaccus), calcareous sponges, Prorichtofenids, and bryozoa, that trap the calcareous mudstone, forming typical stromatactitis.","Mexico","17.5","-99","","-9.80389199038","-47.6323951069","-5.28668","-42.0627"

Abstract of ref. 1849:
The palaeoecology of calcimicrobial communities from the only Gondwana-related Lower Cambrian in Central Europe (eastern Germany, carbonates and siliciclastics) has been studied. Six morphological groups of calcimicrobes are described. Some of them show a significant ability for sediment stabilization and construction of biohermal reef mounds. Other types of calcimicrobes were more common in biostromal thickets. Some of them were capable of populating different environments, growing in different modes and on different substrates. An Epiphyton-archaeocyathan reef mound is described, illustrating the importance of calcimicrobes for mound formation. The fossil communities together with a complex of sedimentary features allow a reconstruction of the depositional history of the environment. Based on comparison with similar Gondwanan Lower Cambrian successions (Sardinia/Italy, Spain) and facies development a model is proposed describing the sedimentary history. Three depositional stages are distinguished: (1) deep subtidal ramp, (2) shallow subtidal ramp, (3) shallow subtidal to intertidal mixed siliciclastic-carbonate ramp with migrating oolitic shoals. In spite of similarities with the deposits in southern Europe, some distinct differences exist with respect to the succession of facies, the completeness of the sections, the fossil spectrum, and the nature of the siliciclastic sediments. For the German Lower Cambrian, a facies development from a low energy deep environment to a high energy shallow environment (partly restricted and with some evaporites) can be reconstructed. As compared with Sardinia and Spain, the depositional environment of the eastern German Lower Cambrian successions was predominantly characterized by low-energy conditions.","Germany","51.6333","13.55","24190","-51.6193971172","5.92138989628","-38.3043","107.545"

Abstract or ref. 1861:
A recently discovered Silurian reef tract in the high Canadian Arctic has an exposed length of more than 150 km and is locally more than 500 m thick. The reefs occur within a Silurian ramp and rimmed shelf-margin sequence about 2 km thick. Conodont biostratigraphic data indicate that the reefal strata are late Llandovery to Ludlow in age, and reefs are composed largely of coral-microbial boundstone, The corals are mainly digitate rugosans and large halysitids, associated with fewer stromatoporoids and lithistid sponges. However, most of the reefal strata consist of microbialite, which encrusts skeletal metazoans or is massive or thromboidal. Microbialite microstructure consists mainly of clotted micrite or laminated micrite associated with common Renalcis, other calcimicrobes, and locally abundant early marine cements. Other reef rock types include stromatactis-rich lime mudstone, cementstone, zebroid stromatactis-bearing lime mud-stone, crinoidal grainstone, and, rarely, stromatoporoid boundstone. The reefs formed on the shelf margin and prograded basinward in three distinct phases during Wenlock and Ludlow time. Underlying Llandovery, shelf-margin facies are highly dolomitized and may represent an original stromatoporoid boundstone. Overlying late Ludlow to Pridoli carbonates were deposited on a prograding carbonate ramp, dotted with small coral-stromatoporoid and other biostromes, Three periods of Silurian reef growth can be recognized in the Arctic: Llandovery, latest Llandovery-late Ludlow, and late Ludlow-Pridoli. The Llandovery phase was widespread, and large stromatoporoid-coral reefs occupied a variety of depositional settings, including shelf-edge, intrashelf, drowned shelf, and slope. Late Llandovery to late Ludlow reefs were also regionally extensive, but were predominantly coral-microbial boundstone and locally grainstone-rich structures containing accessory metazoan (stromatoporoid-coral) framestone and boundstone. These formed high-relief structures with coarse allochthonous debris aprons. Large stromatoporoid-coral reefs were also present, but these were confined to areas characterized by high rates of siliciclastic sedimentation or to intrashelf areas. Another regional change in reef composition occurred in the latest Ludlow. Initially, reefs were rare and dominated by lithistid sponges and microbialites, but in Pridoli time, they became widespread and were constructed by corals and stromatoporoids, as were their Llandovery ancestors. In addition, the Pridoli reefs did not attain the large sizes of reefs in the two older sequences. The three phases of reef development can be related to important, basinwide sequence boundaries. Microbialite-rich reefs have also been described from northwestern Russia, Alaska, and eastern Canada and are some of the largest reef structures known. Their large size reveals a need to reconsider popular reef evolutionary models, in which skeletal metazoans are regarded as the predominant constructors. Large reef size is implied in these evolutionary models, but, based on this and other reef studies, microbialite-rich reefs equal, and commonly surpass, the dimensions exhibited by coral-stromatoporoid reefs. Considering the microbialite-rich reefs, now known from both the Ordovician acid Silurian, it is clear that benthic microbial communities played a very important role in reef construction through the lower Paleozoic.","Canada","79.7833","-74.2167","","7.22720686342","-72.5188602801","4.10332","-25.4951"

A series of reef complexes, reefs, and biostromes have been
reported through a carbonate succession 600 m thick at Tiewadian
(Fig. 5) and equivalent sequences of adjoining areas, north of the
Wei River, Shaanxi Province (Ye et al., 1995, Ye et al., 1996). They
occur on topographic highs of the rifted, southwestern margin of
the Ordos Platform (North China Block). At Tiewadian the sequence
includes a composite, 150-m-thick reef complex composed
of superposed biostromes and reef mounds, a 30-m-thick
biostrome, and discrete, large to small, lens-shaped reefs, from 5
to 35 m thick. A wide range of frame-builders and binders are
recorded, though seldom all groups in a single reef or biostrome.
Stromatoporoid Forolinia (probably Labechia), and microbes
Phacelophyton, Renalcis, Epiphyton, Trichophyton, and Girvanella,
are the main contributors. Less important are algae Solenopora,
Vermiporella, and the corals Lichenaria, Cryptolichenaria, Amsassia,
and Eofletcheria. Some larger reefs exhibit a generalized framework
succession: substrate stablization of bioclasts by microbial
(stromatolitic) growth, in places associated with corals or succeeded
by them, and then dominant Forolinia, and/or less common
Phacelophyton, towards the top. Smaller reefs are mainly
stromatolitic. Vermiporella, though recorded by Ye et al. (1996) as
a major reef builder, may have had a more limited role in
sediment production.","China","34.9167","108.5667","","35.1198870799","92.7779193094","-23.8581","124.452"

Abstract of ref. 1915:
The early Permian reef belt is distributed in the southern side of eastern Kunlun, north area of Qinghai-Tiber Plateau. The core-reef facies of the reef extends from Tuosuo Lake to Huashixia. Lots of reef breccia was found at the southern slope of the core-reef belt, and to the north of the reef belt there is back-reef limestone. Calcisponges, hydrozoa, bryozoa, Tabulozoa, Tubiphytes and red algae are the main frame-building organisms. Archaeolithoporella, laminated blue-green algaes, Tabulozoa and Tubiphytes played a role of binding or encrustating. There are many kinds of epibiont in the reef, including brachiopod, gasteropod, foraminifera, echinoderm and simple coral. The type and the characteristics of the reef- building organisms in eastern Kunlun and Animaqing are basically the same as those in the south of China.","China","35.1167","98.8333","","42.6264638466","62.6954995809","12.9633","73.4828"

As documented by industrial seismic reflection profiles and well data, the Cenozoic stratigraphic evolution of the Maldive carbonate system shows three distinct intervals characterised by their own specific depositional signatures. Late Palaeocene volcanics generated by the Reunion hotspot filled deeper pull-apart structures and created a flat topography that promoted the onset of the Maldive carbonate system in the early Eocene. Some of the initial structural depressions remained as deep internal seaways surrounded by reefal margins until the late Oligocene. The Eocene-Early Oligocene stratigraphic signature is essentially aggradational and corresponds to a transgressive cycle associated with a second-order sea-level rise. In the mid-Oligocene, a major sea-level fall exposed the neritic carbonate system and restricted sedimentation to the former deep internal basins. During the next transgression, a neritic carbonate system re-established itself on the newly flooded platform and was finally drowned near the Oligocene- Miocene boundary. The main effect of this second-order transgressive cycle was the transformation of the central troughs into one single deep basin in the Neogene, the palaeo- Maldive Inner Sea. When a reef framework was established in the early Miocene near the present location of the platform edge, systematic bank margin progradation toward the central Inner Sea basin became enhanced. This Neogene progradational phase is explained as the response to a long-term sealevel fall associated with a second- order regressive cycle. Finally, the late Pliocene-Pleistocene depositional signature is mainly aggradational and corresponds to the regional modification from flat-topped carbonate banks to atoll physiographies. The 'antecedent karst theory' suggests that increased karstification was triggered by high-frequency eustatic and climatic changes in the last 3.0 Ma.","Maldives","4","72.5","","4","72.5","3.27853","72.1108"

Outcrops of the Rajamandala Formation limestone near Bandung offer an excellent opportunity to study the facies -relationships of an Early Tertiary reef, which may serve as a model for Tertiary reef exploration in Indonesia. The limestones are exposed along quarries and natural Outcrops along the road from Bandung to Jakarta. These limestones with thicknesses of approximately 600 meters are dipping 40 to 60 degrees toward the south and are involved in asymmetric folding and thrusting towards the north. 
Along its ENE-WSW trending strike the limestone exhibits a graded granular limestone facies representing turbidites at the toe of the basin-slope facies, a foraminiferal algal facies with rudstone facies representing a fore-reef facies, a coral-algal baffiestone to boundstone facies (locally quarried and slabbe as commercial marble), representing, reef ramparts, and a possible milliolid limestone facies with isolated patch reefs, representing the lagoonal back reef facies. 


CORAL DEBRIS RUDSTONE FACIES: 
This facies consists of angular fragments of corals and other limestones, mostly dark grey, embedded in a limemud matrix, which is generally lighter in color. Fragments, poorly sorted, vary in size up to 30 cm. Matrix contains considerable amounts of large foraminifera mainly Lepidocyclina. This facies represents talus-slope debris of coral fragments from the main reef

CORAL BOUNDSTONE FACIES: 


In general this consists of corals in growth position in which the spaces among the coral framework are filled up with muds containing coral debris, large foraminifera, etc. often bound with encrusting red algae. The rocks are light colored and are usually dense, massive, nonbedded to poorly bedded, with no primary porosity. The following sub-facies can be recognized based on the type of corals: 


Massive Head Corals Boundstone: This facies consists mainly of colonies of massive head corals, such as brain-corals, Meandrina etc. with encrusting red algae. A pack-stone facies, rich in foraminifera, is common in between the coral colonies. Worm tubes are very common in this facies, as well as large shells of gastropods and lamelli-branchia. These rocks are very massive, dense and usually white in color. The carbonates are very pure, containing over 95% calcium carbonate. Recrystallization is fairly. This rock is polished into commercial marble, common. This facies presumably represents the reef crest or reef flat. 


Platy Coral Boundstone: This facies consists of platy corals, which are aligned parallel to bedding. Within the framework of these boundstone are pockets of foraminiferal packstone to wackestone. These rocks are mostly massive and poorly bedded, but occasionally show wavy bedding. This facies presumably represents the deeper environment of the reef front. 

Branching Coral Bafflestone: This facies consists primarily of branching corals, mostly in growth position, some as broken fragments ' , embedded in a limemud matrix. Typical corals are Porites, Acropora, -RhabdophyIlia etc. (Gerth, 1933). Branching coral facies presumably represent sub-wayebase environments of the reef front. 


These three sub-facies are usually intermixed together and cannot be differentiated, but often the platy coral boundstone and especially branching corals bafflestone form' definite facies development, such as G. Pawon and G. Manik. 


REEF DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENTS 


Measured sections at several localities and their lateral correlations indicates that depositional environments of the reef related sediments can be identified, based on the lateral facies developments, as well as each individual facies.

Buildups with a rigid coral framework are generally rare in Lower Carboniferous time. An exception was found in the Hunts Bay
Oolite-Formation at Blue Pool Bay (Gower Peninsula). This bioherm is intercalated in well-bedded oolitic limestones. It is about 25 meters in
width and rises up to 10 meters in thickness. The coral association indicates an Asbian age of the bioherm. The core of the structure consists of
large massive colonies of Lithostrotion and a small number of dendroid colonies (Siphonodendron and Syringopora). Most of the corals are
preserved in living position. The density of the colonies is high, in many cases they grow upon eachother. Dendroid corals become more
common in the outer core. An increase of colonies, which are upside-down orientated, together with broken colonies and coarse debris
describe the facies of the flanks. The general decrease of the amount of corals and the gradual increase of fragments of colonies in bioclastic
rudstones to wackestones at the top of the structure characterize the end of the biohermal development. 

Due to the appearance of a coral framework and its thickness, the bioherm is wave resistant. It is described as the first ecological coral-reef of
the Lower Carboniferous of South Wales.","United Kingdom","51.55","-4.2","36674","-6.33784397876","-36.1979677317","-8.69507","0.068657"

Abstract ref. 1979:
Mid Cambrian reefs with microframe structure built by calcified microbes, probably cyanobacteria, are well-exposed in the Zhangxia Formation near Jinan in
Shandong Province. Members of the Epiphyton, Renalcis and Girvanella groups are almost solely responsible for a series of extensive biostromes, individually up to 15 m thick, in which metazoans are scarce. These reefs are surrounded by coarse cross-bedded oolite-pisolite, reflecting rapid growth in a high-energy environment.
The two main reef lithotypes present are: (1) matrix-rich Tarthinia-Tubomorphophyton thrombolite-dendrolite microclusters, and (2) Gordonophyton-Razumovskia thrombolite microframes. The latter were created by rectilinear arrangement of prostrate and vertical microbial filaments, and the small (millimetric) size of the cavities contributed to framework strength.
Similar, but usually less well-preserved, mid-late Cambrian reefs appear to be widespread in Asia and North America. These North China examples establish
microbial microframes as a distinctive reef-structure, and show that frame-building continued during the Cambrian despite archaeocyath demise.","China","36.65","116.95","81107","23.8192993836","98.7255472595","-2.65453","144.601"

Abstract of ref. 2236:
Study of 35 systematically collected and 10 semi-random samples (about 100 cm(2) each) from one outcrop of the Lankey Limestone (Emsian) near Reefton, New Zealand indicates that it is a reef framestone built by tabulate (4? spp.) and clonal rugose (one sp.) corals, two species of stromatoporoids, a few bryozoans (2? spp.) and crinoids. The guild structure of the reef community and data on skeleton orientation and growth direction further indicate that there was relatively minor biostratonomic alteration of the original community. Skeletons are either in growth position or tipped, toppled or even overturned, but they have remained in situ. Other clone-rich Lankey Limestone outcrops in the Reefton area support the notion of an upper shelf reef system and stratigraphic and sedimentologic data suggest that it was located near the Gondwana margin at a paleolatitude of about 35 degreesS.","New Zealand","-42.1167","171.8667","25785","-46.3688952794","-170.580377927","-22.0626","-177.164"

Age was Lower Miocene. Revised to latest Oligocene in ref. 2574

Abstract of ref. 1993:
During the middle Tertiary, the island of Jamaica was part of a large system of shallow carbonate platforms extending northeast along the Nicaraguan Rise.
Although these platforms undoubtedly supported a rich fauna of marine benthos, the coral communities of this region are poorly known. New exposures in Jamaica,
however, provide a clearer picture of the development of these Tertiary reefs, especially those spanning the Oligocene/Miocene transition, a time of significant
taxonomic turnover in Caribbean corals. 

Recent bauxite mining on the Manchester Plateau of central Jamaica exposed well-developed (5 - 8 m thick) patch reefs in the Lower Miocene of the Newport
Formation. Sections through these coral build-ups have been logged and extensively sampled. This material was compared with new data from similarly exposed
reefs in the Upper Oligocene Brown's Town Formation of north central Jamaica. Cluster analysis and ordination of coral occurrences has revealed similarities as well
as distinct differences between Oligocene and Miocene assemblages.

Both units contain coral assemblages dominated by massive, branching, or plate-shaped colonies. Coral diversity is also roughly the same in each formation
(approximately 20 genera and >30 species). There is some turnover of species between the late Oligocene and early Miocene, but perhaps the most significant
difference between the sampled assemblages is a change in the relative abundance of certain key taxa. Antiguastrea cellulosa, for instance, is the dominant massive coral in the Upper Oligocene assemblages but is much less common in Lower Miocene faunas.

Ecologically and sedimentologically, there appears to be little difference between the coral build-ups in the Brown's Town and Newport Formations. This suggests
that, in contrast to some other regions in the Caribbean, patch reef communities in Jamaica thrived throughout the Oligocene/Miocene transition. Changes in dominant
coral taxa, however, could suggest a complex shift in community structure during this turnover interval.","Jamaica","18.0833","-77.25","69725","19.5903852108","-75.3396814691","17.6694","-75.9209"

Laurentian shelf margin deposits typically are dolomitized or metamorphosed, but the Ledger Fm. contains an exceptionally well preserved microbialite reef complex, riddled with large submarine cavities. The microbialite consists of Renalcis-like shrubs, centimeter-scale domal stromatolites, dense fronds and laminated
fabrics. Petrographically, the microbialite is expressed as clots of spherulites, stringers, arborescent garlands, and dendritic shrubs. Microbial processes dominated all
ecological niches; forming the substrate, colonizing cryptic spaces, coating and encrusting other algae. Cavities within the microbialite formed through a number of previously undescribed processes, at least on the large scale reported here. Organic decay led to the development of stromatactis-like voids on a meter-scale, while syn-depositional slumping and channel formation led to microbial props and folds which resulted in further void generation.  
These large cavities were stabilized with multiple generations of radiaxial fibrous and herringbone calcite cements, intercalated with internal sediment. The herringbone calcite cement has depleted carbon isotopic values relative to the radiaxial fibrous cement, even those within the same cavity. This suggests that the herringbone morphology is related to unusual porewater conditions. In this instance I interpret that the herringbone calcite reflects near anoxic porewaters due to large quantities of decaying microbial material nearby. 

Marine cement stratigraphy, based on petrography, CL, stable isotopes, and trace element geochemistry, demonstrate that the cavities did not fill simultaneously.
Rather, even adjacent cavities exhibit complex patterns of cementation, encrustation, and cement breakage, indicating that the reef's location was in a high energy,
shelf margin setting where storms and local events impacted each cavity differently.","United States","40.3333","-78.3333","","10.1136027171","-110.660945365","-29.6741","-85.8156"

Formed by rudist framestones and bafflestones, the shelf edge-related rudist complexes, unlike the rudist banks, are commonly not well preserved in situ as the main source of the bioclastic sediments (Figure 10). In the Murge region they are clearly associated with (Begin page 1569) the fault systems that form the eastern shelf edge (Borgomano and Philip, 1987), and in the Gargano they occur as megablocks (>103 m3) in base-slope deposits (Figure 11). A detail study of the biogenic components of those bioclastic sands and blocks has shown that they were mainly sourced from rudist associations not found in the inner platform. Combined analyses of a few preserved shelf edge-related rudist complexes and the associated deeper marine sediments have allowed some of their characteristics to be established. They were dominated by recumbents rudists, including caprinids and Sabinia. The diversity, size, and shape of those rudists, commonly associated with rounded and well-sorted bioclastic gravels, suggest that they lived in a high-energy subtidal setting (Figure 10). These shelf edge-related rudist complexes could be considered as reefs (Longman, 1981), defined as carbonate buildups, influenced by organisms, that controlled depositional processes in adjacent zones and were situated on a topographic high.","Italy","41.7","15.95","","33.292271043","15.7113175141","29.5247","14.5181"

degrees. This calcareous alga is known to baffle sediment and build small (~6 m thick) to large (30-100 m thick) bioherms. Examples of Donezella-dominated
bioherms are reported from Middle Carboniferous strata of Algeria, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Spain, and West Texas. 
     A 5 m thick Donezella - siliceous sponge bioherm from the Wapanucka Formation was studied in detail by microfacies analysis. Due to high dip of the beds, the lateral dimension of the bioherm is not known. 
The bioherm overlies thin (20 cm), cross-bedded crinoidal-bioclastic packstone to grainstone, and is capped by peloidal packstone to grainstone The bioherm is primarily composed of Donezella boundstone-bafflestone and peloidal wackestone. In situ siliceous sponge bodies are locally preserved in the lower part of the buildup, by encrustation of micritic crusts and the red alga Archaeolithophyllum. Siliceous sponge spicules are common in the lower half of the bioherm and are rare to present throughout the upper half of the bioherm. The presence of siliceous sponge bodies in the lowest part of the buildup strongly suggests that they played a significant role in initial mound accretion. 
     The green calcareous alga Donezella is common to abundant throughout the bioherm. Donezella builds a delicate framework or colony of thalli enclosing constructional pores. These pores are filled with internal sediments, burial calcite cements, dark micritic crusts and peloids with fuzzy outlines. Toward the top of the bioherm Donezella is increasingly surrounded by carbonate mud. Worm tubes with dark, micritic, encrustations are common in Donezella colonies. 
     The calcareous alga Berestovia (or Claracrusta) is present mainly in the lower half of the bioherm, acting as the primary and secondary encruster of siliceous sponges. Berestovia is also the primary encruster of Donezella colonies. The red alga Archaeolithophyllum is locally present as the secondary and tertiary encruster of siliceous sponges in lower part of the bioherm. Broken segments of Archaeolithophyllum and other phylloid algae are increasingly present toward the top of the bioherm, often encrusted by encrusting foraminifera. 
      Ostracod, benthonic, and encrusting foraminifera are rare to present, but are increasingly present toward the top of the bioherm. Brachiopods, ramose bryozoans, crinoids and corals are rare to present, and are scattered irregularly throughout the bioherm. 
     The bioherm shows a subtle vertical community succession from Donezella boundstone to peloidal wackestone in the lower 5/6 of the bioherm to wackestone
with scattered Donezella, fragments of phylloid algae, ostracodes and foraminifera toward the top. This succession is interpreted as being due to shallowing. The presence of siliceous sponge bodies, the abundance of siliceous sponge spicules, and the lack of high-energy microfacies in this bioherm indicates initiation and growth in a quiet-water environment below storm-wave base in the open-marine / slope environment seaward of the platform-margin grainstone belt.","United States","34.75","-95.0833","76327","-13.5434494236","-55.0456363269","-9.85211","-33.8251"

 During the Early and Middle Viséan rugose corals again occurred widespread within shallow water marine environments. To some extent they accumulated to form reefal structures. The significance and function of related rugose corals were highly variable. In order to achieve a systematic approach Lower Carboniferous biostromes and biohermes were examined in different geotectonic settings north (Belgium) and south (France: Montagne Noire) of the European Variscian orogenic belt. 
     In the Montagne Noire the Viséan to Namurian sequence is part of large olistoliths originating from an active continental margin. Limestone olistoliths yield different shallow-water communities. Bioherms show a community consisting of calcareous algae, cyanobacteria (e.g. Orthonella), and bryozoans. Accessory brachiopods, corals, molluscs, siliceous sponges, and foraminifers occur. Sporadically there are intercalations of dark, well-bedded pack- and grainstones (part of peri-biohermal facies). Some of the olistoliths yield a rich coral fauna. Most abundant are solitary corals (e.g. Axophyllum), but in some cases colonial forms contributed to the formation of biostromes and small bioherms. They were dominated in changing compositions by Lithostrotionidae, Lonsdaleia and Axophyllum.
These small structures seem to be bound to lagoonal or inter-biohermal settings. 
     In Belgium coral biostromes occur throughout the Viséan. Siphonodendron martini occurs in the capping-beds of the cryptalgal-bryozoan Buildup of Bomal
(Middle Viséan). During the Late Viséan a diverse coral fauna inhabited the microbial mounds of the Campine Basin. From the same interval two biostromes are known form Royseux (northern limb of the Dinant Syncline). These biostromes show important contributions by Lithostrotionidae. 
     In general Late Viséan and Early Namurian coral biostromes and bioherms appear to represent local niches. The reef-building potential seems to be relatively high if rugose corals and encrusting organisms co-occur.","France","43.55","3.3333","50810","-13.0019601441","-10.0370205906","-11.8918","12.5759"

Abstract ref. 2010:
     In the Guadiato Area sedimentation occurred during the upper Viséan to form the Sierra de la Estrella outcrops which belong to the Sierra del Castillo Unit The
Guadiato Area is located on the boundary between the Ossa-Morena and Central-Iberian zones, in the south-western Iberian Peninsula, where Lower
Carboniferous outcrops are numerous. Buildups development has been recognised in most outcrops of the Sierra del Castillo Unit, and they are located at La Casa
de la Calera, Peñarroya, Sierra Boyera and Sierra de la Estrella. Although the stratigraphical setting of the first three sections has been previously described, their
buildup development and morphologies are different to those of Sierra de la Estrella, whose buildups are thicker and more abundant. 
     The stratigraphic succession from Sierra de la Estrella is dated precisely as upper Viséan by means of foraminifers (Zone 15 of Mamet). The main guide taxa are:
Palaeotextularia (bilaminar), Cribrostomum, Vissariotaxis compressa, Howchinia, 'Monotaxinoides' sp., Endothyranopsis crassa, and the Microproblematicum
Saccamminopsis fusulinaeformis. Sediments at Sierra de la Estrella show characteristics of a storm-dominated transitional zone between outer and inner ramp. The
outstanding feature of this ramp is the development of microbial buildups. They may be called mud-dominated buildups or mud-mounds because they are
mud-dominated (they show more than 50% of mud). They are regarded as microbial mounds because they are mainly composed of organomicrite and show
common stromatactoid cavities. 
     Two main morphologies have been identified: 

     1. Tabular mud-banks; they extend laterally for 1000 m to 1300 m, and are 35-60 m in thickness. 
     2. Domal mud-mounds; they have variable size; they are 2-25 m in thickness and 4- 40 m in diameter.

Buildup types were related to sedimentological conditions; domical mud-mounds were developed in transitional facies between the inner and outer ramp, with
variations in the environmental conditions, while tabular mud-banks were developed in more stable conditions in an outer ramp setting. 
     Microbial buildups are interbedded with tempestites and marls. Some siliciclastic beds showing erosion surfaces and hummocky cross-bedding also occur 
     The sedimentological and paleontological characteristics of the Sierra de la Estrella section allow us to recognise two deepening-upward sequences (probably of
4th order), which are integrated into a major transgressive sequence (belonging to a 3rd order cycle). This glacio-eustatic cycle is recognised in upper Viséan
throughout the Guadiato Area, so it could be envisaged that it will influence all outcrops from this epoch within the Ossa-Morena and Central Iberian zones.","Spain","37.95","-4.8667","39708","-18.0144790464","-31.9459328223","-17.6934","4.10675"

Abstract ref. 2011:
     The gas saturated Zechstain Limestone Reefs within western and south western direction from Poznan have been recently discovered. These are Papro W reef
nearby Nowy Tomy l Town and Koscian - Bonikowo Kokorzyn reefs located nearby Koscian Town.  Koscian and Papro reefs and Bonikowo Kokorzyn reefs
were discovered with 2D and 3D seismic respectively.  The reefs were formed in the inner part of Zechstein See about 60-80 km north from the off shore carbonate
platform. The genesis of the reefs is strongly connected with a local Carboniferous paleo highs called Wolsztyn High (Fig 1). The paleo-highs are formed with
carboniferous sandstone (Koscian area) or Autunian volcanic rocks (Paproc_W area) and  they were covered by shallow see. In this shallows there were mainly
bryozoan reefs and oolitic-oncoidic carbonates deposited. Additionally, mostly at the top of the reef the stromatolite occurs. Porous reef body, characterised by
thickness of up to  90 m is surrounded by deep basin limestone facie which is deposited as thin (up to 5m thickness) tight mudstone. 
     Below this the most important parameters of the reefs are presented: 

     Porosity very good up to 35 % 
     Permeability variable 0.1 3000 mD

Paproc-W Reef, area 4 sqkm, top depth 2450m TVDSS, thickness 50-80 m -The first discovered by 2D seismic Zechstein Limestone Reef in Poland.  All its
thickness is gas saturated. The accumulated gas contains 40 % of hydrocarbons. 

          Koscian Reef ,  area 20 sqkm, top depth 2100m TVDSS, thickness 60 m. Koscian Reef is the largest of all discovered reefs body (Fig.3). 
          There is gas-water contact at the depth of 2208m.The resent discoveries allowed to located new Wielichowo and Ruchocice Reefs at NE from
          Koscian Reef. 
          Bonikowo Reef, area 9 sqkm, top depth 2260m TVDSS, thickness 90 m. 

     In 1999 several new reefs was discovered i.e. Rensko-Kokorzyn-Bronsko and it seems to be the largest discovered reef, however  shape of the reef was
interpreted from 3D seismic and wait for the wells drilling.  The reefs saturated  gas contains 81 % of hydrocarbons (80.5 % of methane) and 18 % of nitrogen. 
     It is very important to notice that the efficient reef prospecting is possible thanks to 3D seismic survey.  Both 2D and 3D seismic was shot by GEOFIZYKA
Toru.  Especially it is worth emphasising that final success is a result of a co-work of many people; geophysicists, geologists  and engineers. Presently, thanks to
excellent co-operation between POGC - Oil and Gas Zielona Góra and GEOFIZYKA Toru S.A. the exploration of the Zechstein Limestone reefs has become the
priority task for the companies operating in the western Poland","Poland","52.0833","16.6333","","26.2844590984","29.014658899","18.4727","25.7241"

Biostromal structures have been identified in the upper Valanginian and lower Hauterivian (lower Cretaceous) deposits along the Crimean mountains (USSR). The structures have been formed by scleractinians, algae, and rarely by hydrozoans. Reef facies first appeared during the upper Oxfordian (upper Jurassic) and northward migration of some 25-30 km continued until the Hauterivian. The migration was influenced by tectonic movements and uplift of Kimmerian massifs.","Ukraine","44.8333","34.5","77072","36.1106786106","45.4419235201","37.5144","40.2138"

The structurally low Yauco basin began to receive volcanic rocks, clastic rocks, olistostromes, and olistoliths in Maastrichtian time. Campanian reefs which had grown on the uplifted Jurassic crust slid northward into the basin. Emplacement of reefal debris and olistoliths was synchronous with volcanism and uplift.

During a recent cruise in the Porcupine Basin, off southwest Ireland, we discovered two extensive and hitherto largely unsuspected deep-water reef provinces, including a giant cluster of hundreds of buried mounds. The ring shapes of many reefs suggest that they are caused by an axial fluid expulsion at the sea bed, a transient flow well confined in space and time. We are exploring various hypotheses, but a stimulating avenue for research is opened by a glacially controlled growth pulse and subsequent decay of a shallow layer of gas hydrates as a methane buffer and probably indirectly as a ground for overlying biological communities.","Atlantic","52.3333","-12.75","","52.27421652","-12.6570046563","52.3499","-12.9102"

Abstract ref. 2036:
In Glacier Bay, Alaska, Silurian limestones record the development and demise of a stromatolite reef complex in the Alexander terrane. These microbial deposits are of regional and paleontological significance because they contain paleogeographically distinctive biotas and yield important insights into Phanerozoic stromatolites that inhabited normal-marine subtidal environments. Willoughby limestones exposed on Drake Island reveal that stromatolite growth at the platform margin influenced platform dynamics with the protection of peritidal and lagoonal habitats behind a reef-fringed rim, which experienced early lithification by the precipitation of synsedimentary marine cements. Relatively low-energy subtidal conditions in a restricted, shallow-marine lagoon are implied by the peloidal and mollusk-rich wackestones, packstones, and grainstones. At the platform margin, stromatolite boundstones and cementstones capped a reef-like mound by forming a thick microbial-cement crust on a core of outer lagoonal sediments. Well laminated, fenestral mudstones and peloidal wackestones-grainstones have an abrupt lateral contact with the microbial boundstones, indicating their formation in peritidal flats adjacent to the stromatolite reefs. Foreslope breccias consist of clasts derived from shallow subtidal environments on the shelf and at its rim. Cyclic repetition of these deposits indicate that sea level fluctuations and tectonic instability in the Alexander terrane contributed to periodic shedding of shallow-marine detritus to the upper slope, followed by the rebuilding of stromatolite reefs at the platform margin. Culminating stages in the Klakas orogeny induced large-scale, catastrophic collapse of the carbonate platform. Silurian stromatolites characterized by similar habitats and microbial-sponge biotas in southwestern Alaska and the Ural Mountains, Russia, together with paleomagnetic data, detrital zircon evidence, and the timing of late-stage Caledonide events, firmly establish genetic and temporal links of the Alexander terrane with other areas along the Uralian Seaway.","United States","58.6333","-136.2167","79359","11.1735791413","-114.035022491","-2.69102","-91.5554"

Abstract ref. 2040:
Stromatolites have been recognized as opportunistic disaster forms following the end-Permian mass extinction. This occurrence was attributed to the partial relaxation of ecological constraints in the aftermath of the mass extinction. A similar pattern occurs in the Great Basin following the Late Ordovician mass extinction in association with a shift to low-diversity, generalized faunas.

Most Late Ordovician-Silurian faunal communities in the Great Basin are diverse and limited to relatively narrow environmental zones. Thin (10-20 cm thick) stromatolites occur throughout the section within inner-shelf tidal-flat facies. After the mass extinction, earliest Silurian (Rhuddanian) communities are broadly distributed with low diversity. Associated stromatolitic and thrombolitic mounds increase in abundance and reach a thickness of 2.5 meters. Bootstrapping analysis suggests the restriction of thick mounds to the post-extinction interval is non-random (probability <0.5%).

The widespread shelf stromatolites and thrombolites of the early Paleozoic declined, probably because their habitat was disrupted by the evolving Paleozoic Evolutionary Fauna. By mid-Ordovician, stromatolites and thrombolites were small and restricted to marginal, inner-shelf environments. They temporarily regained prominence in the aftermath of the Late Ordovician and end-Permian mass extinctions. In the earliest Silurian, shelf communities were undifferentiated in the long (3-4 MY) aftermath of the mass extinction. Thick stromatolites and thrombolites disappeared when diversity increased and differentiated communities were re-established. This patterns suggests animals that were suppressing stromatolites and thrombolites were reduced or absent after mass extinctions.","United States","40.9167","-112.8333","","-15.3736656261","-125.876802786","-6.23614","-71.8369"

Abstract of ref. 2041:
Most of what is known about the biotic recovery from the end-Permian mass extinction has been recovered from strata deposited in shallow-water environments. Yet, properties of the deep-ocean have been invoked as causes for the mass extinction as well as the unusually prolonged biotic recovery from this crisis. A nearshore to shelf transect of the Lower Triassic Virgin/Schnabkaib Limestones of the Moenkopi Formation (southern Nevada) was studied for changes in facies types and biofabrics as well as comparison with the coeval outer slope to deep basin Union Wash Formation (eastern California).

A number of biofabric trends were documented across this transect. Vertical burrows are common in nearshore strata, while horizontal burrows are prevalent in shelf strata. Intervals with relatively high ichnofabric indices (ii 4-5) are more common in shelf than nearshore strata. The most intriguing biofabric trend is the lack of microbial structures, such as stromatolites, in the most nearshore section, with their greatest occurrence found in shelf strata. This anachronistic onshore-offshore trend of stromatolitic development points to offshore and oceanic environments as a likely influence on their formation. Presence of seafloor carbonate cements in coeval slope and deep basin Union Wash strata, implying an offshore presence of water masses supersaturated in calcium carbonate, suggests that unusual ocean chemistry may have played a significant role in the development of Early Triassic shelfal stromatolites.","United States","37","-117","","16.1729977663","-42.48998498","8.80244","-42.7408"

From Webby:
Localized stratigraphically within the Goldwyer Formation, of probable early-mid Darriwilian age, and occupy restricted sites immediately adjacent to a major, intra-basinal fault zone (Admiral Bay Fault Zone). Four separate occurrences of these linear-shaped, microbial-dominated reefs are recorded along the main Admiral Bay fault line over a distance of 16 km. They vary from 500 m wide and 330 m thick to 200 m wide and 25 m thick, and at least one is more than 1 km in length. The reefs exhibit a primary reef framework of domical and digitate stromatolites. Flanking deposits are bryozoan and pelmatozoan grainstones, and packstones. The fault system which defines the northeastern margin of the Willara Sub-basin, was apparently active intermittently through Early-Middle Ordovician time. McCracken et al. (1996) suggested that uplift of the footwall side of the main fault produced a narrow, raised, linear belt along the line of the fault, providing suitable shallower depositional conditions for localized reefal growth. The timing of uplift is possibly early Darriwilian. These reefal masses were subsequently fractured by renewed phases of faulting that facilitated movement of mineralizing solutions and extensive alternation of the host rocks, with the emplacement of the Mississippi Valley-type, lead-zinc mineralization.","Australia","-18","123","","-0.35113193214","98.7713999261","10.0489","153.622"

Abstract of re. 2094:
Carnian reef biota and brachiopods of the Misfah Formation (Hawasina complex) from a locality near the town of Al Aqil in Oman are described. A new brachiopod species, Oxycolpella arabica n. sp. is described. The composition of the Carnian reef biota in Oman is similar to those known from the Alpine-Mediterranean region. However, differences exist in the microfauna of reef dwellers, e.g. foraminifers. New stratigraphic data based on reef organisms and conodonts are presented.","Oman","22.7833","57.8333","49417","-23.4526917258","45.9478549094","-18.5132","49.1123"

Bioclastic debris without corals and algae

The first visible level of the reefal unit is formed
by coralline algal thickets associated with a number of coral colonies belonging to the scleractinian
genera Porites and Tarbellastraea. The overlying
unit exhibits more distinctive reef features through
the presence of metric-sized coral patches and
scattered coral colonies. Two different growth
forms of Porites occur (possibly two species): one
with densely packed finger-thick branches, the
other partly massive, partly ramose (often within
the same colony), with branches about 5-10 cm
thick. Coral constructions also contain globular to
ramose colonies of Tarbellastraea with frequent
Lithophaga borings. Thin Porites colonies domi-nate
near the top of the reefal unit. Scleractinian
colonies and mollusc shells (especially bivalves)
are often invaded by a network of boring sponges
corresponding to the ichnogenus Entobia. Among
the samples from Dio'sd, Oosterbaan (1990)
identified the following scleractinian species:
Porites collegniana, Tarbellastraea reussiana, and
Siderastraea crenulata.

Coralline algae also play a major role in the
construction of the framework. They encrust the
surface of coral colonies with up to centimetre-
thick sheaths around thin Porites colonies, or give
rise to bushy outgrowths. Coralline algae are some-
times also associated with bryozoan crusts.

The amount of siliciclastic material decreases upward, and at a distinct masses of red algae appear as encrustations covering an area of some 100 m2, possibly a hardground (which is not exposed). Upon parts of this algal build-up coral colonies occur, and locally become dominant (Müller, 1984). The algal-coral build-up is capped by a pebbly horizon and no further beds are exposed here. Further to the NW, a possibly coeval slightly clayey limestone contains abundant Turritella moulds, probably deposited in a sublittoral setting. The transition zone between the build-up and clayey limestone is not exposed. The clayey limestone is covered by a calcarenite ( Müller, 1984),partly grainstone, partly wackestone,with some faunal evidence for slightly decreased salinity.","Hungary","47.3667","18.9167","34739","46.0527338963","16.2319757459","46.6851","18.4484"

Abstract of ref. 2127:
The limestone of the Tianheban Formation on the Yangtze Gorges belongs to open shelf marine deposit in middle Early Cambrian age. Two distinct types of archaeocyath reefs are preserved - an isolated archaeocyath mud mound, and a patch reef. The reefs are composed of irregular archaeocyathids and calcified microbial microfossils such as Epiphyton, Renalcis, Givanella, etc., belonging to baffling reef mounds. The patch reef succession shows the hydrodynamic changing from low energy to moderately high energy, and then to a low energy environment.","China","30.6667","111.3","81010","-9.87767984942","79.0339579572","24.2711","158.13"

Two distinct types of archaeocyathan buildups occur within the Lower Cambrian Todd River Dolomite: a high energy, intemittently emergent, bioherm and grainstone reef-shoal (30-50m thick), and low energy open-shelf bioherms and patch reefs up to 8m thick and 20m across. The primary fabric of these buildups has been largely destroyed by dolomitisation. Facies relationships indicate that high and low energy buildups are temporal equivalents, and that the high energy reef-shoal now present in the N'Dhala Thrust Sheet was flanked to the east and south by a low energy shelf studded with bioherms and patch reefs. The reef-shoal was capped locally by microbial mudflats. The best potential for hydrocarbon accumulations appears to be local open-shelf buildups draped by thick halite deposits in autochthonous and para-autochthonous areas.","Australia","-24.5","131","80921","4.69809638467","98.1075041885","19.1368","-170.436"

Sedimentary facies in the Carboniferous part of the Omi Limestone are generally highly diverse, but their diversity varies in each age. The Upper Carboniferous part consists of highly diversified facies including fore reef, reef front, reef crest, sand shoal, and lagoon facies, while a simple facies assemblage, composed only of fore reef, reef front, and sand shoal facies, occurs in the Lower Carboniferous.

 The first phase, comprising the coral-bryozoan-crinoid community, occurs in the Endothyra spp. Zone to the Eostaffella kanmerai Zone (Visean to Serpukhovian).","Japan","36.9958","137.7667","24131","7.80961862281","65.6627517869","-3.51906","82.6876"

This is a typical Wenlockian carbonate mud mound community, in which the core contains mostly carbonate mud, sometimes with Stromatactis-like structures, and echinoderm debris and the flank beds are echinoderm-dominated. Skeletal grains in the flank beds which contain this community can be either moldic or dolomite-replaced, and the texture ranges from non-cherty, porous dolowackestone to dolopackstone, with some grainstone present also in the flank facies, to crystalline dolomudstones and sparse dolowaxkestone to dolopackstone, with some grainstone present also in the flank facies, to crystalline dolomudstones and sparse dolowackestones in the cores. Skeletal grains show the full range from well to poorly sorted, and some graded bedding is present in the inclined beds of the echinoderm facies. Corals, which tend to surround the mound core, are sometimes overturned (Philcox, 1970), and in any case, are not abundant enough to form an organic framework. As noted by Witzke (1981b, 1987b), the general absence of skeletal boundstone fabrics precludes interpretation as an organic-framework reef, but the presence of apparent penecontemporaneous cave and fissure-fills in the core, often with thick trilobite or nautiloid concentrations, plus wedge-shaped debris flows in some facies, suggests that the mounds were rigid features, possibly resulting from submarine cementation processes (Witzke, 1987a). Dolomitized botryoidal and fibrous marine cembents are present. Sedimentary features are consistent with episodic high-energy conditions, such as would result from storm action in depths generally at or slightly below fair weather wave base.","United States","43","-88.3333","13353","-26.9483889586","-89.7938784966","-21.4529","-51.9119"

Normalograptus extraordinarius graptolite zone

Abstract of ref. 2275:
The Late Ordovician stratal succession in the Carnic Alps, an area that lay at about 50 degrees south latitude in the Ordovician, includes bioclastic carbonates derived from reefs. Two distinct facies have been distinguished in the Carnic Alps Late Ordovician succession: an inner shelf, Wolayer, facies and an outer shelf-upper slope, Uggwa, facies. Wolayer facies carbonates are massive, structureless, and accumulated as reefs which developed as thickets of crinozoans, primarily cystoids, and trepostome bryozoans. Cystoid calices are common at some sites. Conodonts, chitinozoans and trilobites are present in the reef rocks. These crinozoan-bryozoan reefs developed in relatively shallow-shelf, subtidal environments. Reef-derived detritus was swept downslope from time to time to accumulate in a sequence of graded debris flows in deep shelf-upper slope settings. These carbonate clast debris flows are a characteristic component of the Uggwa facies. Siliclastics subjacent to the Uggwa carbonates bear Rawtheyian shelly faunas. Blocks within cross-bedded sandstones and siltstones superjacent to Uggwa carbonates bear Hirnantia faunas. Persculptograptus persculptus and Mucronaspis occur in interbedded silty shales. Correlations based on faunas in strata subjacent and superjacent to the carbonates indicate that the reefs developed during the Normalograptus extraordinarius graptolite zone. Late Ordovician glaciation on Gondwana occurred during that zone. Siliclastics are absent from the reefs and reef-derived carbonates. If the source for the siliclastics was a portion of Gondwana, then reef development during glaciation suggests that the reef-building organisms were permitted to grow because the reef sites were not impacted by fluxes of siliclastics. The abundance of crinozoans and bryozoans suggests that small plankton were plentiful and nutrient availability high.","Austria","46.5833","12.9167","","-56.965900159","27.5702451815","-64.4765","87.5002"

Part of abstract of ref. 2353: The observed buildups are approximately 3 meters across and 1 meter thick. Each buildup is composed of circular 'heads' of layered microbialite with an internal clotted texture (i.e. thrombolite). Individual heads are approximately 0.5 meters in diameter and 0.25 meters thick. Environmental interpretations of these microbial buildups suggest that they developed in shallow water (< 1 meter water depth).
As many Jurassic thrombolite reefs discussed in the literature have been interpreted to have developed in deep-water settings, examination of these well-exposed Wyoming reefs provides important contributions to extend the distribution of thrombolite reefs into shallow-water environments.","United States","44.5333","-109.05","","37.2356663416","-41.1506077202","35.9239","-48.6679"

Lithistid sponges prevailint (Lee pers. comm. 2023)

A sponge-microbialite reef horizon occurs in the upper Cambrian (Millardan) strata of the Arrow Canyon Range, Clark County, Nevada. This horizon represents one of the few metazoan reefs occurring between the extinction of the Archaeocyathids at the end of the early Cambrian and the proliferation of Calathium-sponge-microbialite reefs in the late early Ordovician.

Good exposures of the reefs occur discontinuously on the western slopes of the Arrow Canyon Range. Uneven dolomitization obscures some reef structures while creating patches of well-preserved reef rock that are up to 15 m thick by 50 m wide. Some dolomitic intervals between reef mounds reveal faint reef-like textures and structures, therefore the shape and extent of the original reef(s) is uncertain. The interval may have extended into the overlying dolostone and the original reef may have formed distinct mounds larger than 50 m wide, or a single continuous biostrome over the 8 km exposure. 

The reef(s) show an ecological succession from basal-domal stromatolites (0.5 m wide, 1 m tall) to digitate stromatolites (5-20 cm wide, 10-20 cm high), a core of sponge-thromolite reef (3-7 m thick), and a cap layer of columnar stromatolites (20 cm w., 1-2 m h.) with attached and detrital sponges between the columns. Sponges in the core have thin walls (1-2 mm), and are broadly conical to bowl-like in shape, (5-10 cm w/h). They form a closely packed framework that is in-situ with pendent microbialites; Renalcis and Epiphyton. 

Age determination is currently supported by 4 conodont collections from strata underlying the reef through the reef core. Strata below the reef have Proconodontus muelleri and are assigned to that zone. Eoconodontus notchpeakensis occurs in the stromatolitic base and indicates the E. notchpeakensis Subzone of the Eoconodontus Zone. Palaeobotryllus taylori, also from the Eoconodontus Zone, occurs in the core.","United States","36.5833","-114.9","","30.9039186096","-122.416123283","-1.67019","-91.5257"

Data from sections A5 and K3b.  the reefal limestone is composed of three depositional facies. These depositional facies are from base to top: 1) fore-reef facies, consists of hard, massive, marly coralline limestone with low diverse, small isolated corals heads, 2) reef-core facies, which consists of very hard, bioturbated coralline limestone with exclusively huge coral colonies of Porites and Tarbellastraea spp. and, 3) back reef facies, consists of sandy to pebbly massive, bioturbated limestone with very low diverse, scattered, small dendroid and massive heads of corals. The studied reefal limestone was deposited in fore-reef framework in an open marine environment with moderate to high energy conditions and changed upward to shallow marine facies with accumulation of skeletal grains by storms during regression.","Egypt","28.8417","32.55","","21.3324154563","28.1887609678","17.469","27.0358"

Patch reefs form a principal reservoir facies in this limestone. These reefs more closely resemble Carboniferous aged Phylloid-algal mounds than the more typical Givetian and Frasnian age buildups.

The patch reefs attained a maximum thickness of 25 m and had a maximum relief above the sea floor of approximately 13 m. The dominant reef formers were platy stromatoporoids which grew in an upright, interconnected manner similar to that of phylloid algae. Renalcis typically grew on the underside of these stromatoporoids, partially filling the shelter cavities while finer sediment accumulated on the tops of these stromatoporoids in a geopetal fashion.","Canada","59.7833","-120.55","","4.60492184017","-115.385858912","-5.91508","-39.3327"

the cyanobacterial microbialites Tubiphytes and Archaeolithoporella, with a few large

reefs are made by in-place conical skeletons of Gundaria insolita n. gen. n. sp. that
were adjacent but not always in contact with the substrate. The Gundaira insolita
were also able to trap loose sediment, which indicates that the reefs are matrixsupported.
In-place, pedicle-attached species contributed to the framework and helped
trap the matrix. These reefs were likely laterally extensive despite their low
topographic relief, which is consistent with the mostly bedded nature of the Gundara
Formation. The abundance of matrix and the reduced cementation and bioerosion
suggest muddy depositional environments, which were probably deeper and more
turbid than those of the Safetdara Formation.","Tajikistan","38.45","70.53","182702","38.0788532194","59.1910635083","24.5625","70.3551"

Peritidal settings were interpreted within Logs 1 and 4 with ages constrained between the late Murgabian to Midian.
Platform interior contains three sub-environments: lagoon, the outer platform and the higher energy backreef. The low-energy lagoon is comprised of bioturbated skeletal and peloidal wackestones and packstones with localised interbedded shales. The fossil assemblage contained abundant algae including Girvanella, bivalves (including alatoconchids), fusulinids (N. simplex) and microscopic non-fusuline foraminifera (Globivalvulina, Schubertella, Cribogenerina and Textulariida). The lagoonal environment is interpreted for lower Log 4 and upper Log 6 and deposited in the Murgabian with possible extension into the Midian.
The outer platform sub-environment is a non-parallel bedded bioclastic limestone grading from wackestone through to grainstone with boundstone interbeds. Isolated coral clumps were also observed within the grainstone sections. Inner platform settings were interpreted within Logs 1, 2, 5, 7 and 8.

these sponges are preserved in life position, their initial essentially

The sponges are associated with small serpulids within a very abundant micritic matrix, and with common echinoderm plates (probably crinoids) locally reworked as bioclastic accumulations in storm-induced deposits. These biostromes, tens of centimetres thick, are formed by alternating gregarious settling and hydraulic reworking. The latter leads to multiple short-term events of hard-part concentrations in a low to moderate energy mid ramp environment.

The succession starts with coarse-grained rudstones followed
by meter-sized reefal blocks intercalated in partly layered resedimented grainstones
and packstones with abundant reef-building organisms like calcareous
sponges, corals and encrusting organisms. Inside this part of the succession
open-marine influenced layers are rare. The succession continues with a partly
turbiditic sequence and chaotic rudstones, densely packed with reef-derived
material like broken reef-building organisms and shallow-water material like
gastropods, bivalves and foraminifers. Grainstones with clear open-marine influence
(e.g., thin-shelled bivalves, crinoids, conodonts) appear in between those
rudstones, in cases lumachelle layers consisting of halobiids were deposited. To
the end of the succession some layers show turbiditic bedding with mixed shallow-
water and deep-marine grains and organisms, i.e. filaments and crinoids.

Hindeodus parvus conodont is present. the putative keratose sponge consortia were identified
from a thin-bedded, spar-cemented oolitic limestone below the basal microbialite unit. It overlies unconformably above the uppermost Changhsingian bioclastic limestone. Above this oolitic limestone layer, the thrombolite is characterized by a clotted texture of reddish sparitic patches embedded in a grey micritic matrix, whereas the overlying dendrolite texture consists of brownish sparitic patches embedded within a yellow micritic matrix (weathering colour). Several shell layers containing microgastropod and bivalve fragments, ostracod tests, and intraclasts occur above the microbialite unit (Fig. 2). Above these shell layers is the succession dominated by micrites interbedded with peloidal wackestones. In the oolitic limestone layer, single ooids are 0.2–0.6 mm in diameter and round to oval in outline, occupying 55–65% of entire petrologic texture, and they are unevenly distributed. These ooids are strongly micritized so that concentric lines or radial structures become vague. Some grains retain outline of bioclast remains, mostly gastropods. The pores between the ooids are normally cemented by sparites and micritic clumps (micrite aggregates) are interspersed occasionally, indicating an intermittent high-energy environment. Light-coloured sparitic structures are rather common and evenly scattered and almost fill the dark-coloured micritic clumps. Some elongated individuals show vermiform shapes, while others are filamentous and branch occasionally. These dot-shaped and filamentous structures form maze-like networks. Single filaments vary in length, ranging from 100 to 500 μm, while their thicknesses are relatively consistent, except for tapering ends. Individual filaments are 10–70 μm (averagely 33 μm) in diameter, with filaments of 20–30 μm in diameter being most frequently occurring (nearly 20%). About 60% filaments are 20–40 μm in diameter. Filament is slightly inflated at the junction when branching, and these filamentous sparitic structures tend to be distributed parallel to the edge of the micritic clumps.","China","29.05","114.58","","11.9108230644","129.971413686","14.6023","101.449"

Large subglobose coral colonies (Actinacis, Antiguastrea, Astrocoenia, Favites and Agathiphyllia) and sublaminar and globose colonies of bryozoans are typically in life position. The displaced colonies are rare and typically bear no evidence of transport (bush-like colonies of e.g.,Actinacis seem to be only fallen down). Generally colonies preserved in situ are immersed in a bioclastic packstone that, with a sharp contact, passes to a grainstone wich disoriented discocyclinids. At the top of this fades present are also debris ßows with branching corals like Acropora, Stylophora and other large bioclasts. Abundant coralline algae and specimens of pectinids and other molluscs are also associated with this facies.

The high (28%) average porosity of the reservoir is dominantly related to strong development of microporosity, moldic and vuggy porosity.
Skeletal grains are dominated by non-geniculate coralline algae and large benthic foraminifers (Fig. 3A, B, C). Corals may be common in a few intervals (Fig. 3D). Non-geniculate coralline red algae are dominated by encrusting to branching forms, commonly forming nodules (rhodoliths) (Fig. 3A). The dominant genera are Lithothamnion, Mesophyllum and Sporolithon. Larger benthic foraminiferal association is characterized by Lepidocyclinids, Spiroclypeus, Cycloclypeus commonly displaying flat-shaped morphologies (Fig. 3C).
